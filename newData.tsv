I have been in a state of stress and anxiety almost constantly. My fall in earnings has been crushing and demoralising. I don't qualify for any form of financial relief.

In 2020 the event was held entirely online and much of the programming work was done by the core team. I contributed some content, but for considerably lower pay. The SOA's contingency grant and SEISS payments helped keep my head above water - without them I would have struggled to pay my rent.	Positive impact	Production of audio dramas was able to continue during lockdown, with many actors recording from home. This allowed me to carry on working through much of the year, and I used the time to work on other projects. In the months before the pandemic I had been struggling to find work, low on funds and suffering badly with depression. Though it was a worrying time for us all, writing provided a distraction, an income and a way to pass the time. There were other times when I wasn't as productive and when the jobs became more sparse, but ironically that seems to have happened more since restrictions began to ease.	0	Never		Moderately confident	1	No	1	1	1	I had been contracted early in the first lockdown to write an as-yet untitled audiobook. This project stalled before the story was developed, but when we returned to it at the tail end of 2021 I came up with an entirely new story concept. Though I'd been paid for signing the contract in 2020, I believed it was my right to request a new contract referring specifically to the project we were now working on, and the producer agreed. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0				0			0			1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%		Percentage of net receipts		No		0			A company that I've written scripts for has changed their contracts so that writers can no longer invoice for the second half of payment on delivery of a manuscript, but when that script has been fully approved. This has drawn the process out considerably. "Full approval" often means the script editor, producer, director, company boss, and usually - if it's a licensed series - BBC approval. Once this has been achieved there is a 30 day waiting period from invoice to payment.		Not changed	Male	35-44	White	2	Degree	1	W	CF24				1

Not changed	Female	55-64	White	1	Other	1	S			You dont have a 'don't know' box to tick; and the assumptions/questions about sources of income are all rather 'at the professional level', whereas many of us (inc. me) scrub about in the less grand parts of the landscape of writing, where things are less organised and less certain. It may be a career, but there is no 'career path' for most of us. This disorganised aspect of earning from one's words is never really considered.. how one has to rely on tax credits, grants, small earnings for broadcast repeats, just to keep alive, let alone undertake 'a career'. As you should know, there are tides in the lives of all creative artists, long periods of being out of favour etc (esp for older women). Those, while hard to assess, are part of the wider picture of who gets paid for what and why.	3

I'd just published a joint-edited anthology with a well-known publisher in Scotland, and was on track to publish my own collection of fiction with another new small publisher. When the pandemic hit, my bookseller job put me on furlough, my anthology publisher ran into a rough patch (as did everyone), and my prospective collection publisher folded. When my bookseller job opened up again, prior to any vaccine roll-out, the health and safety provisions were all but non-existent, and for the sake of physical and mental health, I quit. (While this was a decision I made myself, I do consider it a knock-on effect of the pandemic, as I would have stayed on had management taken the new challenges of operating under a pandemic seriously.)  In 2021, my collection of fiction found a home with a publisher in the USA - in retrospect, I should have waited to place it with a more stable publisher closer to home who knew how to market the book to a local audience, especially as the publisher has stated that as a result of COVID damaging their own financial stability, they plan to wrap everything up and close shop by the end of 2022. I've been lucky in other ways, though - the anthology was partly funded by Creative Scotland, which meant I was able to apply for their COVID support grants, and my position on the magazine board as designer and editor has provided some regular work. However, compared to 2019, I'm now fully freelance, and entering 2021 have no income currently lined up for the coming year, writing or otherwise. I'm putting myself out there to secure work, and hoping my publisher lucks into a lucrative marketing strategy, but it's feeling very unlikely!	Negative impact	The knock-on effects of the pandemic on previously stable or hopeful aspects of my professional life have massively reduced my productivity, and ramped up my background stress-levels. I've lost my stable part-time income to cover basic outgoings, so much of the time I could be writing, I'm spending designing and editing for the literary projects of my peers, or hustling for work. Meanwhile, what felt like a rising trajectory as editor and writer has been scuppered. After losing what felt like a good relationship with a local publisher when they folded, I panicked and sold my debut collection to the first publisher to show interest. Being based in the USA and (to put it politely) with too much on their own plate to dedicate themselves to any of their authors in a meaningful and supportive way, this was in retrospect a mistake. COVID pushed them to their limit, and they now plan to wrap everything up by the end of 2022, locking me into a five-year contract with a publisher who won't exist within a year and a half of publishing my book. It's not ideal.  I've also been trying to write a satirical dystopian sci-fi for the last six years, with key themes being global inequality, insular ideas of nationality, mass delusion, scientific scepticism, food inequality and governmental corruption. All of this was relevant before the pandemic hit, but experiencing it dialed up to apocalyptic levels in real-time really sucked the life out of the project. I'm still intending to finish the book, because I've never finished anything this length before, and I think there's merit in reaching the finish line, but the last two years have been a slog, and my heart isn't in it any more. That, combined with my collection being a minor flop due to poor publisher support, has really damaged my confidence in knowing what the heck I'm doing with my professional life, as far as writing is concerned.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	Before I secured a publisher, I put out a zine of some fiction and poetry that wasn't included in my collection.

Not changed	Male	35-44	White	2	Degree	1	S	G20		As someone earning the majority of my income from literary-adjacent work - design and editorial - the initial segment was a little difficult to navigate. It's not writing, but I do make money from writing, just not enough to confidently answer questions on income which don't allow for a jack-of-all-trades portfolio career that includes roles that exclusively feed into the literary sector without being literary themselves. I understand why the survey is the way it is though! I just also know *so many* people who have a writing career, *and* a writing-adjacent career that is neither journalistic or academic - and journalism and academia have very high barriers to entry, whether financial or social connections. A broader understanding of how people find their way to writing as a career would have made the earlier part of the survey easier to navigate.		1

The accessibility of technology for writers to self-publish is creating an overwhelming volume of work, much of which finds only limited markets. This has undermined the value of work that might involve risk for traditional publishers.  There is a woeful polarity between the gargantuan sales at the top of the tree and the mess at our industry’s roots. Here is where most writers cannot survive as authors, and yet the self-publishing/writing ecosystem helps them to thrive and encourages them to convince themselves that a big break is just a matter of time. This is good for the ecosystem of advisers, editors, proof readers, designers, printers, runners of workshops and creative writing courses etc. But it may not be sustainable long term. At the top of the tree, the enormous amounts of money poured into marketing celebrity works and cookbooks for the obese, is shameful.	0	0			1	0		1	No change	Percentage of net receipts		40-59%	40-59%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I have not seen any new contract since 2019 so cannot answer this.

I've not been able to meet up with my agent for two years, because she's shielding. I have had less writing time because of the demands of other people who are less busy than they used to be (and I've offended some by insisting I won't answer the phone in the morning because I need to work). I'm also supporting my composer husband morally - he's extremely stressed by Covid and is unable to work, which naturally upsets him. I'm not sure if I'm stressed or anxious, exactly, but I am more strung-up, and I'm definitely in mourning for a life I was happy in, and won't get back, between Brexit and Covid - for example, I don't see us travelling abroad any time soon.

It also had a gagging clause - no appearances within three months either side of the festival - which I had already broken with a book launch and which I found totally unreasonable, given that I was a local author unable to travel off the islands due to covid - this was my only venue. I asked the SoA to comment on the provisions, and wrote myself to the organisers - who agreed that the contract was a one size fits all aimed at bands, and unsuitable for this festival. They sent me a new version with those clauses crossed out.	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0				1	1-9%		1	0		1	Substantially decreased	Other	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Other	They have stayed the same	No		0					Not changed	Female	55-64	White	2	Masters	1	S	ZE2				1

My earnings in 2021/22 have been significantly higher than 2020/21, but that could be due to a number of factors. 	No impact	It's genuinely hard to say. I was making less money, but enough to cover all of my expenses (my cost of living is quite low) without dipping into savings, so I wasn't overly stressed. I was basically kept afloat by a group of supportive editors who continued to give me work. These were primarily contacts established pre-pandemic. 	0	Never		No confidence	0	No	1	1	1	Negotiating rates	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Other						Don't know		0					Improved	Female	35-34	Mixed	3	Degree	1	E	N4				1

The WGGB model is beyond broken and the union are not serious about professional writing.  Most IP sales I’ve made in the last year refer to an accepted minimum for the complete rights - usually under £1,000. My agent testified that in the UK, this is fairly standard.

Many production companies have a development backlog which still needs to work through the system, so they are less likely to buy new material.	Negative impact	As writing was one of the few creative outlets available for people in the dramatic sphere during lockdown, it meant many actors, directors, designers, producers had time to write ‘that screenplay’. Consequently there is now a glut of original scripts on the market, so it is much harder for professional writers to get materials read and sold - particularly as there was already a backlog of scripts in development anyway.	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Agent	Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1	10-39%	Increased	1	1	1	1	No change	Other				Other		No		0			Less enthusiasm for production companies to pay a decent rate for treatments/ideas.

Also, lack of networking opportunities led to fewer consultancy fees and backlog with publishers resulted in book proposals not being accepted.

I gave in rather than lose the work.	The publishers are more often just giving a flat rate, not allowing moral rights, and even the number of free author copies has been reduced - usually to only one copy.	I was uncomfortable about a clause saying that I was liable if the editors decided more than 10% of the work needed changes, then I would be charged the editors fees.

It is clear that now, ELT publishers generally are very reluctant to offer royalty-based payments and instead have moved to fixed payments for what they term 'content' (people who used to be called authors are now content providers). This has not directly affected me since almost all my contracts were agreed before 2010, roughly when this shift began. Although it has not affected me, it certainly has affected many colleagues and the profession in general.		Weakened	Male	65-74	White	2	Masters	1	Other		1			0

The firm's only project was terminated at the start of lockdown in March 2020, as the charity for which I was working was forced to furlough its own staff, and ultimately to let many people go (a large proportion of the charity's income came from use of its building as a conference venue, bookshop and cafe, none of which could continue as usual during the pandemic).  My husband ceased taking his small salary from the company, whilst not being furloughed and continuing to market the business. I was furloughed, and increased the amount of time spent on freelance work as a copywriter for websites.  Fortunately there was plenty of work on offer there, though the rate of return was very low, meaning very long hours for less than minimum wage.  I was fortunate enough than one of my books started to sell well from Jan 2021, though I did not see any return from that until the end of August 2021. The pandemic also meant that I spent more time on writing, and completed another book more quickly than I probably would have otherwise. That's why, despite the loss of income from other sources, I've said that it's had a positive impact on my professional life as a writer.	Positive impact	I experienced some anxiety around making ends meet. And I was initially anxious that my book, published in autumn 2020 alongside a slew of others that had been delayed from the spring, would simply disappear without a trace. I was very fortunate that that didn't happen, and the positive news about sales from Jan 2021 onwards is probably a big reason for my more optimistic outlook about my writing career. I know how easy it would have been for things to go very differently.  I've also appreciated the ability to catch up with people on Zoom rather than having to travel, and I feel I've been able to participate in events I would not otherwise have been able to - e.g. Virtual Noir at the Bar (online readings in place of the Manchester-based event), online book launches from other authors, etc.	0	Never		Less confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price		0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			No new contracts during this time, so I'm unable to comment	No	Improved	Female	45-54	White	2	Degree	1	W	SE13				1

Then it becomes a vicious circle - I'm not doing festivals this year because I don't have a new book to promote, nor do I have income from foreign sales. So although the immediate impact of the pandemic was cushioned by a very welcome grant from ACE, the real effect will only be seen this financial year, and perhaps the next one. Hopefully things will start to improve after that, if I can afford to keep writing meanwhile. 	Negative impact	Although the pandemic did lead to increased productivity, it led to the breakdown of my relationship with my main publisher when they rejected the final part of a trilogy, citing lower sales of book 2 which were impacted by the pandemic. This led to a crisis of confidence and decreased presence on social media, increased anxiety and stress.   However, with the support of my agent, I have continued to write, exploring new directions, and have written a new series which has secured two contracts so far in the UK and EU. I have also explored new writing directions thanks to a grant from Arts Council England. This in turn has led to renewed confidence and resilience.   I'm about to start doing public events again. After a gap of two years, I am both excited and anxious about this, and hope they will go well and restore some of the satisfactions of this career - I miss speaking to an audience. 	1	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	0	1	1	My agent negotiated certain changes around audiobook licenses in the EU, and delivery dates etc. 	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0				1		Decreased	0			1	Substantially decreased	Other	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I changed publisher in the last year, and the new publisher had a different contract, so the changes are related to that, rather than being the same publisher creating changes.   With regard to my first publisher, I had one two-book contract followed by a single book contract, with slightly less favourable terms, but I didn't feel confident enough to challenge it.

The main impact on my earnings has been in writing programme notes for concerts, which in 19/20 made up a large part of my earnings as a writer, but which in 20/21 almost completely dried up as live music came to a stop. This was offset a little by the sums mentioned above, and by a shift on my part towards some online teaching. This was made possible by the online environment of the pandemic but is something I hope to continue.	No impact	Both negative and positive. The opportunity to teach online has been a big plus, and the regular meetings with my (private) students have been extremely rewarding. Once the shock of home schooling my two children wore off I was able to maintain my productivity (fewer social engagements etc helped in this respect). Overall the pandemic has forced me to make decisions about what I think is valuable in my life - health, family, homelife, etc. - that have been beneficial to my mental health, and have built layers of resilience and resourcefulness that were not there before.  On the negative side, I miss the opportunities for contact with peers and colleagues that came with concert attendance (I work mostly as a music critic). I worry that I have lost ground in this respect and am not as up to date or as well-connected as I once was. I also miss live music per se; as a CEV shielder I have been cautious about attending events even when I have been able to. This has forced me to write more from the position of what I know already, rather than what I have newly encountered. This has been OK so far – I have reasonably good resources of knowledge, I think – but it is not a sustainable situation and I worry what happens when those reserves run out.	0	Never		Moderately confident	1	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1	1-9%	Stayed the same	0			1	No change	Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			None that I can recall.

Then I claimed the SEISS grant, which was helpful.   Then I started to write about COVID-19 and more non-COVID writing also became available. From then the inflow of work (and income) has been relatively steady.   I used to sometimes work from cafes but have since switched to only working from home, which has saved me money.   I also do some tutoring on the side and used to travel to my clients' houses but since the pandemic began, I switched to online tutoring only, which has saved me travel costs. Although there was more competition for tutoring work due to people losing their jobs, so I wasn't able to take on much tutoring work. 	No impact	I am definitely more anxious and working from home all the time has meant decreased productivity some of the time. Yet I am a lot less effected than others and have been grateful that the transition to working from home has been much easier for me than other people I know.

At the same time, I received no payments for continued sales of some other books he'd published and I'd written.	None, I'm afraid. Because I have had  only self-published works.

ALCS (and the WGGB) are working well on behalf of writers. Many thanks for that.		1

They are less likely to do development work in-house and so authors have less of a one-to-one long-term relationship with publishing team.  In general, with some exceptions, authors are valued less.

I've been able to make it work for 2.5 years but at significant personal cost and it seems to be getting tougher and tougher, with more writers competing over smaller (and fewer) budgets. There seems to be an assumption that this is a young person's game, but newspapers and magazines don't seem to be looking to bring writers on staff to develop. The churn is high. I've now been a working writer/journalist for 12 years and I'm worried about where I go next.		1

I was let go from from my role as a school teacher, due to needing to shield as clinically vulnerable. This cost me my £27,000 salary and there were no GCSEs to mark in 2020 or 2021 (I'm contracted to mark some this summer). I do a couple of thousand pounds of tutoring a year now. My earnings from royalties also seem to have dipped significantly, roughly £8k. I don't know how much of the royalty decrease is due to covid or reflects changes in the popularity of my book series.	Positive impact	With the loss of my job as a teacher, this has naturally freed up more time to write, which is positive. I hope that this will result in additional books in summer 2023/24.

It also gave me a lot more time to write, as I hadn't realised how much time and energy (and money) is spent on conventions.  Over the past two years I haven't been socialising often with existing friends or making new friends, and haven't returned to most of my recreational activities (ie gym classes) or hobbies. This has meant even more time to work, for better and worse.  I also haven't been able to proceed with the final stages of a series of surgeries that has disrupted my schedule for the past few years, giving me more time to work but also making it more difficult to work due to associated poor mental health.  Some fluctuations aside, my sales have remained broadly the same but I had more time and mental space to devote to starting a new pen name in a different genre, which has already proven much more lucrative.	Very positive impact	Strangely, the pandemic has meant much more productive time, as well as time to think about what I most value, which has driven my motivation to work. More consistent book releases have greatly improved my income. On the other hand, the mental health toll has been intense.  Greatly increased anxiety and stress has also been hard to cope with, as I've been following Covid news and scientific literature since February 2020. As the pandemic unfolded, I felt responsible for reading up and sharing knowledge that wasn't discussed often (eg the importance of masks, and aerosol transmission vs fomites), with friends who don't have the luxury of my free time and research experience.  It also led to a sharp crash in my mental health when my unidentified ADHD spiralled out of control due to losing all my external hobbies, which were coping structures. This eventually triggered my diagnosis and treatment, and hopefully will mean a long-term shift from unsustainable treadmill-style work into slow, consistent work for the long term in my career.  With all my free time, I also had a chance to finally write and release what became one of my favourite books of all time, which sold so poorly that I realised my then-genre had become a bad fit for me. I was able to pivot to starting a new pen name in a different, much more lucrative genre.	0	Never		Moderately confident	1	No	1	1	1	A foreign publisher had a contract referencing a rights reversion if they hadn't produced the translated work by the agreed-upon date, but there was no specific agreed-upon date in the contract, so I asked for that to be included.   At another foreign publisher I also negotiated a slightly higher royalty rate in exchange for no upfront advance, and a tiered second higher royalty rate after a certain number of units sold.	0	1	0	0	0	0	1	0	1	Other	Fiction self-publishing has been my primary income source since 2013. My income figures provided earlier are from my personal tax return and not my corporate tax return, so the costs incurred are not accounted for; roughly 20% of my company's gross income goes to costs (audio narration, editing, proofing, cover art, marketing, software subscriptions, convention/swag costs in normal times) and another 20% to corporate taxes, leaving 60% profit for my personal income, but I prefer this business structure to self-employment.  I don't think of marketing time etc as unpaid time, though the description may be apt since most "marketing time" (especially by self-publishing authors) is spent incredibly inefficiently. I know which roles within my business I'm best at, and I focus on genres and a publishing model that complements those strengths (for example, one that doesn't demand social media presence or require extensive time spent on marketing/Facebook ads/the like).  Self-published print channels make up a vanishingly tiny amount of my income, in both foreign and English, and my genre is not popular in bookstores or libraries. Most of my income comes from KDP Select or Audible sales, with the rest flat Amazon ebook sales.	1	0			1	0		1	No change	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	60-79%	60-79%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have gone down	No		0			I have only begun signing contracts with other parties (foreign language publishers) in this time frame.

Best practice is 1) gender: male/female/nonbinary/other; 2) is this the same gender you were assigned at birth? yes/no; it also includes explaining why the latter is relevant and necessary--similar to collecting gender info, for equalities/economic monitoring?  This is because trans status is a separate category from gender; transgender is not a gender in itself. A trans man would need to tick both transgender and male and can't, so they may have chosen one or the other or "prefer not to answer" when they would otherwise actually be happy to share this information. A nonbinary trans man like me gives an entire paragraph answer :)		1

I adapted my business model and am now working for a global corporation writing training materials, thought leadership pieces and research papers. This has increased my earnings from writing. I saved considerable amounts of money by working from home as I did not have to pay for travel (approx £5,000 a year) and I was significantly more productive without the travel time.	Very positive impact	I have been able to pivot my business to focus more on writing activities, both fiction and non-fiction. This has increased the amount of time I spend writing and coaching others writers. My productivity has also increased as I am better able to manage my social anxiety and workload. However, my mental health has been severely impacted by prolonged periods of shielding and the inability to meet up with other creative people to share ideas and support. I now pay for counselling and relaxation classes to support my recovery. Also, I had a writing project go badly wrong because a co-writer tried to publish my work without permission, something I can only put down to the stress of lockdown as he is now undergoing psychiatric assessment. This has left me with a 4 year project in ruins and a legal battle which is likely to cost thousands if I want to protect my work.	0	Yes, sometimes	Professional body/union	Moderately confident	1	Yes	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	This has been self-publishing on my website and social media as a way of marketing my business.

Negative impact	As I moved into digital publication, the pandemic simultaneously forced mainstream publishers to take digital more seriously. My small digital publisher had to work harder and spend more to have the same impact and to remain competitive in terms of sales. On a personal level I found the pandemic extremely stressful, especially as I am CEV, and this affected my output, particularly at the beginning of the pandemic, when there was so much uncertainty. 	1	Yes, sometimes	Other	Moderately confident	0	No	0	1	1	I asked for changes to a boilerplate contract.	0	0	0	0	0	1	0	0	0				0			1	0		0		Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have gone up	No		0			The digital publisher I've recently signed with pays a greater percentage royalty on  the net sums earned.

Publishers are also breaking down these tiny payments into three tranches, and to add insult to injury, are delaying publication by up to 18 months.		1

I was unable to hold events to promote a self publishing venture I had already committed to, which resulted in a substantial loss. My publishers (who relied heavily on sales to libraries and author self promotion) saw a fall in book sales and dropped me, so I am now without a publisher. The TV series for which I had acted as consultant had to suspend filming and was ultimately cancelled. I wasted time preparing lectures and courses which were commissioned, then cancelled as restrctions came and went in a way which rendered any forward planning a complete joke.  Essentially the COVID 19 pandemic has wrecked the successful career I spent a decade building up.	Very negative impact	The COVID-19 pandemic has cost me most of my work. This resulted in frustration, financial problems and anxiety. Many in society continue to be anxious with the result that there are still fewer lecturing opportunities available. Book shops continue to avoid hosting events and signings. Lingering societal anxiety and restrictions continue to impact on what work is available, making it hard to build back up... and after two years, contacts built up with some organisations have been lost. Things are far from back to normal from the earning point of view. As I writer I found that the enforced solitary confinement of lockdown had an advese effect on my mental wellbeing and my ability to create. It is no exaggeration to say that my professional life has come close to being destroyed, probably less by COVID-19 than by the lunacy and hysteria which has surrounded it.	1	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	1	I hoped to nclude an obligation to publish a pb version, in addition to an e-book, but this was not accepted.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	Electronic publication	I had planned to promote the book with personal appearances, lectures and signings in the relevant area of the country, but the pandemic put paid to that. This makes costs much harder to recoup.

The agency demanded some changes which I complied with and the publisher sent the revisions to the agency. The agency demanded more changes at which point I showed the publisher how and why the agency was incorrectly interpreting what I had written At this point the publisher refused to send any further material and proceeded to published the book on the delayed timetable (about 6 months later than promised).

Positive impact	Overall I'd say positive because my sales have increased and I am finding new readers. I had events cancelled in 2020 but I don't tend to run many anyway. I'm as productive as I was before the pandemic, I think, and I have a new source of income from editing. There are stressors, of course, but I think it's probably easier for writers than for most professions - I now see two of my writer friends regularly using Zoom and also coach another writer. 	0	Never		Less confident	1	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	Self-publishing is brilliant but it requires time to learn how to advertise, promote, understand the market, learn about covers etc, in order to achieve a good return on the time spent writing. However, I can write what I like, and as many books as I like. I'm in the process of investigating getting my rights back on the one series which is in a publishing arrangement for its ebooks, as after an initial flurry of activity, the publisher hasn't done much to promote them. 	1	0			1	0	0	0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	60-79%	60-79%	60-79%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0			None as I write for myself	No	Improved	Female	45-54	White	4	Masters	1	E			Lots of the markets you asked me to rank at the start of the survey don't apply to me and there's no way to indicate that.

Other series were launched as pandemic hit so whether they have been affected isn’t as clear, but I know as an industry, book sales were affected. So going forward, my income might be affected more substantially. Writing fees also being driven down by publishers knowing there are lots of writers who want the work. 	Very negative impact	Decreased productivity.  Increased competition and more ruthless pricing from publishers.  Accelerated move to digital in educational publishing though that has affected me less as a children’s writer than writers of educational materials for adults, as children still need to attend school and have course books even if their lessons are online or hybrid. 	0	Yes, sometimes	Other	Very confident	1	Yes	1	1	1	I always get non compete clauses taken out or made limited and specific.

Bad timing as editors were furloughed and response times extended. I lost my cleaning jobs or had reduced hours because employers didn't have the money (plus couldn't go into households during lockdowns). Tough times. And then when I got a deal, the advance was an appalling £1500 - which seems an industry standard now for smaller authors.	Negative impact	Increased stress, but mainly due to my 4 teenage sons. I found it EXTREMELY DIFFICULT to work during lockdowns with 4 boys trying to do online learning at home. Been very worried about their mental health and that's impacted mine.

During the pandemic, I found that I became far more reclusive and lonely, struggling to maintain much social contact. Much of my writing is in the local travel and adventure sport industry and because I couldn't do much of that, I found I was working far more than before and not taking any breaks or time off.

I retired from part-time academic employment in October 2019, and with Lockdown found myself at work at home on writing projects, unlike the Prime Minister and others in government. Because I have an exceptional library at hand, I could finish projects at home, and engage with new ones as well. I did have acute Covid-19 in March 2020, and lost 13,5 Kg in ten days. A long recovery, but soon back to writing using resources at hand.	No impact	On my professional life, virtually no impact, apart from curtailing my social engagements and, ultimately, making me a bit restless. Daily walks in my neighbourhood in recovery from Covid-19 after March 2020 were a necessity. Much of my time is spent at my computer, either working with research tools or with my own library, so apart from a bit of stress, the impact of the pandemic was minor.   On reflection, I should say that a book schedulled for release in October 2021 was held back, and will now be released in October 2022, so there was that impact.  A book chapter, a journal article, a review, and two of my own projects were also delayed across the pandemic: the review went to the publisher today, the book chapter goes to the editors tomorrow, and revision of the journal article is next. Then I return to two delayed projects and a few other scraps. It was not all bad news: two colleagues and I have virtually finished another book which was begun just as Covid-19 hit town, so that is waiting in abeyance and irregardless of the state of the world.	0	Never		Very confident	1	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Traditional publication	I have self-published three items, and prepared a fourth.

My self employed earnings were only impacted in that my intended book release in 2020 was delayed by 7 months. I did not notice any tangible difference in sales for my books during the pandemic.	Positive impact	Though being employed as a writer enabled me to hone my craft, write in different styles and learn more about copywriting, it has become stressful working fully from home and in front of a computer screen.  My self employed works have enjoyed some benefits in working from home in being able to conduct more interviews and podcasts and general deal with more people remotely to promote them.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	Yes	1	0	1	No.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			None.

Well researching and editing another edition of my book. The earnings and payoff will come later on. Now on my third edition of this book I always found that it would pay off eventually. From experience as a self publisher it is not easy to make money. That said I have covered the printing and distrubution costs and made a profit.		Not changed	Male	65-74	White	5 or more	Degree	1	E	ST5		As a self publisher a lot of the questions were not relevant. As for my income I preferred not to disclose this. I have written for in-house on-line and magazine publications but they never pay at all. I think that they expect people to write for nothing. That's my experience of the herbal and naturopthic profession since 1979 when I qualified. The issue should be corrected. ALCS have been very supportive for me as I did not know about rights. They have helpedme to get payments which I never knew I was entitled to. I did write to my MP about royalty payments for writers. Aaron MP for Newcastle under Lyme wrote back a great letter ending it with 'I understand that there are no current plans to increase the overall amount of the PLR central fund in response to the Covid-19 outbreak or more generally. The British Library administers the PLR Scheme on behalf of the Government and the funding level of the PLR would form part of the consideration of the British Library’s overall funding at a future Spending Review'. Not much help there.		1

I also was not expected to attend events in person which was actually a real lifesaver as I was diagnosed with a long-term illness last year.  On the downside, my debut novel came out just after Super Thursday at a time when I believe the publishing industry was suffering from overwhelming book launch fatigue due to all the postponed publication dates. I was fortunate to receive great support from the community but I do think lots of new books simply got lost in the tide and many authors suffered as a result.	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Other	Moderately confident	0	Don't know	1	0	1	The contract was with a Russian publisher and they were not interested in making the amends suggested by the SOA lawyer.

The publishers argued that Matsumoto had written a new introduction to the collection and therefore he was entitled to be editor alone. However, we had worked with the original contributors, finding them, editing their contributions etc. Eventually we were acknowledged in small print inside but have received no royalties from the sale of the APA version of our book.

The task involved reversioning existing materials that I had written to a new format for delivery. The publishers wanted to pay a flat fee, whereas in the past any such reversioning has always continued to pay royalties on the existing material being reused (in proportion to the amount of reuse). After myself and another author stopped work on the project, the publishers eventually offered us a contract that continued to pay royalties as the company had done in the past. During the process I took advice on the initial proposed contract from the Society of Authors.	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	This is a very broad question, and I could write a whole essay!  So instead, I will just say that my knowledge of self-publishing was gained from reading around the subject, and taking some on-line courses about formatting, advertising etc, and using their advice. I have also found Facebook groups very helpful for sharing ideas and for getting readers.	1	1	0%		1	0		1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of net receipts		60-79%	60-79%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	Yes	90-100%	0					Weakened	Female	55-64	White	2	Other	1	E	GL12		My answers may seem confusing because I write in two very different areas: - educational materials for a large publishing company - self-publishing fiction Royalties are very different, there are no contracts involved in the latter, etc. So my answers include a mixture of responses.		1

I couldn't leave my children unattended and my husband works in essential services (police) and had all his leave and rest days cancelled. I had no choice but to leave my job and look for remote and freelance work which has been very slow.	Negative impact	The pandemic has increased my anxiety 10 thousand percent. I can't plan anything in advance anymore as I don't know when the schools will close or my kids may need to isolate. I find it harder to set and achieve goals for my career as much of it feels out of my hands. My health has suffered and I am waiting to see a consultant at the hospital. Pandemic stress has made things so much worse. Living on half your usual salary when there are bills to pay is so stressful. I'm hoping that I can increase my income this year but like many women who had childcare or caring obligations during the pandemic, I feel like my career has derailed and won't progress like it should have had we not had the pandemic.	0	Never		Very confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price		0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have gone down	Don't know		0					Weakened	Female	35-44	Mixed	4	Degree	1	E	NN15				1

Newspapers have cut their music coverage. The competition, as a freelancer, to get assignments has become harder.  Speaking engagements have almost all been moved to Zoom, and fees have tended to go way down. For example, 100 pounds to talk on Zoom at Oxford University; same for London University. The biggest fee I was able to get was doing a ticketed series of talks arranged by a US organisation.	Very negative impact	Decreased productivity because it's harder to find paid work.

In addition, film work was delayed over 2020 due to nobody knowing what was going on and then I think shooting will ultimately be delayed because with the expense of testing and all the stopping and starting at the studios around London a lot of productions are behind, and it’s my understanding that larger productions are taking priority. At the very beginning of the pandemic I had a novel submitted to publishers and half the feedback we got from editors was that they were feeling very down and dark and worried an edgy, darker novel wouldn’t be what readers wanted in the near future. I don’t know if that’s specifically the case anymore, but I would expect publishers are and have been responding to covid over the last two years. I know several authors who had their releases paused over 2020, then had to wait for all the releases that had been paused before them to come out before their book came out, and of course that would have delayed the hardback or paperback payment of their contract. 	No impact	I like to try and give meaning to things. I’ve had a very hard year aside from covid, with three deaths of immediate family members. Covid shows me life can be tumultuous and nothing is guaranteed. It’s made me both pull back from work to shift focus more to family, and also focus on getting one project to a stage where I’m really, really happy with it before sending it out. I think there’s been a subtle shift in publishing, as there was after 2008 and as I’m sure there will always be in times of uncertainty, to conservatism. I’ve been thinking seriously about how else I can bolster my income and lower my expenses and perhaps to take selling books at eg 5k as a win where before I would have hoped for no less than 30k. 	1	Yes, sometimes	Professional body/union	Moderately confident	1	No	1	1	1	I asked for more money!	1	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0		1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I haven’t had a new contract in the last year; I’ve been working on ongoing ones.	I felt the amount I was paid to write for a major U.K. TV network was too low for the amount of work; I only realised after that although the contract said 4 weeks they expected me to work a lot longer on the project than that and receive many rounds of notes. It didn’t feel good to be working so hard and know those working as employees for the channel were on a lot more than me. I also felt it was hypocritical for the channel to be professing to be promoting diversity when there was no way for me, an ordinary middle class person (as opposed to an upper middle class person, meaning anyone sending their children to private school) to continue with the job without dipping into savings and putting myself into a precarious financial position. I stayed because writing for them is one of the “top jobs” I could get in the U.K. and I really believe in the project. 	Improved	Female	35-34	White	2	University entry	1	E			Thank you for running this survey and asking me to participate. For me personally, having a contract as a screenwriter that said “5k for 4 weeks” and then everyone at the tv studio saying “oh well that’s just rough, take all the time you need” and realising that in fact the contract says that to not appear illegal, because for the amount of time screenwriters end up working on these contracts we are paid, per hour, we are working for less than minimum wage. In my decade long career, I have never earned less than 25k per annum until 2019, when I found myself trapped on one of these contracts (because, of course, I wanted my project to get made, so I couldn’t kick up a stink and make it feel unpleasant for the execs to work on—given that they decide what gets made and where they spend their time it’s obvious that it does matter the “vibe” they get from working on a project). So the big issue with covid was that my government handouts were based on the previous year (because the years before I had had a ltd company and had recently closed it down and switched to self employed, so I had just one year of accounts and not two for them to base my handouts on), along with the issue of responses to a submission mentioning covid and that readers may not want to read anything dark, and the film project going into limbo for six months while we all tried to figure out what was going on and how long it was going to affect in person casting (which had already begun) and pre production. So I don’t think covid presented me with terrible problems... but it perhaps compounded the issues I was already experiencing with pay. 		0

This was from 2006 to 2014. In 2015 I handed the journal  over to another publisher who  dropped the book format in favour of publishing only as a journal (They are now regretting this choice and trying to go  back to publishing one-off books based on selected articles from the journal). More recently, my self-publishing has mainly taken the form of blogs and other more ephemeral online publishing. The main things that put me off self-publishing were the enormous amount of time spent dealing with quite small technical glitches (eg missing fonts) and the frequency  of upgrades, requiring 'relearning' the software,  the expense of software licenses for things like Indesign and Photoshop, and the hassle of processing payments. There are also more general problems, not specifically to  do with self publishing such as the pressure to publish things open access and (if one resists this pressure) the problem of having material that should be paid for circulated illegally, including being uploaded onto platforms like academia.edu and researchgate. Finally, there is the problem of plagiarism.	1	1	60-89%	Increased	1	0	0	1	Substantially decreased	Other	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Other	They have gone down	No		1	Both attribution and integrity	It was a complicated dispute, eventually only resolved through the intervention of  the NUJ.

Weakened	Female	65-74	White	1	PhD	1	E	NW1		there are a few inconsistencies between the descriptions of possible sources of income in different parts of the survey - eg commissioned research is not listed as an option in the earlier part of the questionnaire but is then referred to later. it might also  have been useful to have a better breakdown of types of writing (eg biographies, childrens books, technical manuals) and other types of editorial work (eg proofreading, indexing, copy-editing, translation) finally, a better breakdown of other sources of income might be useful (eg benefits, pension, renting out property, work for online platforms, crafts)		1

I earn my living mostly from popular non-fiction. I have written well over 1000 of these books, and only on four have I ever received royalties.  Publishers insist on flat fees in which they buy out all rights for all time in all editions – the only way I know of ways in which my work has been used is by searching the internet. The fees and degree of creative control has slumped dramatically over the last 10 years, and the only way i have been able to sustain a living is by churning out dozens of books a year, by ghost writing and by writing as contributor, etc.  Over the last 10-15 years, the fees have dropped by two-thirds in real terms – and if you allow for inflation, that might be 80-90 per cent.  This is at a time when worldwide sales of books I have written has risen substantially  The lack of royalties is a major issue. The books I write sell in huge numbers around the world but I receive nothing from this. One of the few books I have been given royalties on continues to bring in several thousand pounds a year, and is a a very valuable aid to survival. Had i received just average royalties on all the 1000 or more books i have written, I would certainly be a multimillionaire, rather than struggling to make ends meet.   Many non-fiction authors I know have been forced to leave the business by the drop in earnings, or supplement their income from other sources. It can mean that only authors with independent means can continue to write, which precludes many people from non-privileged backgrounds becoming authors.  It also means that agents are uninterested in representing them, because the earnings are so small. People outside the business cannot believe that as one of the world's most published, best-selling authors, I cannot get an agent in the UK.   I supplement my earnings by translation. Here again, the translator is rarely able to retain copywright or proper credit, though moves are afoot, thank goodness, among many translators to rectify this.		1

I found it impossible to create credible near-future or contemporary settings that, by the time a piece was published, was not almost certain to be wrong on many levels (even contemporary stories involve me trying to portray the 'contemporary' of two or three years in the future, which would be when the story gets published). I had to abandon one well-developed novel project and spend months re-casting it as a near-historical piece; and since then it's taken me a long time, and a lot of trial and error, to work out strategies for creating story settings in such a rapidly changing world.   In addition to this, my partner is immune-suppressed, so our lifestyles during the pandemic have been even more curtailed than most; and as I'm the one with the stronger immune system I've taken on more responsibility for anything that involves going out into the world - with impact on my writing time and schedule.  Psychological impacts on creativity have been significant.  Finally, I'd note that my figures are deceptive: financially I've actually earned more during the pandemic than in previous years, but this is because I took on a one-off project with good fees. If this had been a 'normal' two-year period my earnings, with those project fees, would have been significantly higher than they ended up being. So what should have been two good years have ended up being two marginally better years, and that's where the financial impact of the pandemic has hit.	Very negative impact	As noted in my previous answer, the pandemic has had significant impact on my productivity and creativity. (I put all the details in my previous answer, as the consequence of this drop in productivity and creativity has had financial impact.)  I would, however, like to emphasise the psychological and emotional impact. I've been a full-time writer on and off for more than three decades, and I've always prided myself on writing through thick and thin; I never get writer's block and I always finish what I start. The two years of the pandemic have been significantly different, and it's been a huge struggle to work out how to maintain creativity during all this.	0	Yes, sometimes	Agent	Moderately confident	1	Yes	1	1	1	I can't remember exactly, without trawling through lots of emails, but I think examples would include reversion terms, increasing advance payments and the weighting of those advance payments. The latter negotiations were mediated by my collaborator's agent, but the specific details and requests came from me. All of these negotiations were successful.  I didn't refer to model contracts or other recommendations, although I've done so in the past. I also regularly use my own previous publishing agreements as reference points in negotiations. The latter strategy was successful in negotiating the agreement for a project I edited over the past two years, where the initial offer (from an organisation with no experience in fiction publishing, so while they were well-intentioned their terms sucked) was a straight work-for-hire purchase of all rights; I negotiated this to a contract based on some of my own previous publishing contracts, and the project's contributors ended up retaining copyright and only licensing rights specific to the project's use of the works.	1	0	1	0	0	0	1	0	1	Electronic publication	I run an independent publishing imprint, in ebooks and print on demand. This started as a self-publishing venture (simply because it was easier to learn the ropes with my own material), republishing works that had already appeared via traditional publishing routes. This expanded to publishing the work of other authors. At times over the past ten years it has been my main activity, but the market has become less friendly to small ventures like my own and I've moved back towards traditional publishing in the last two or three years.	0	1	10-39%	Increased	1	1	1	1	Slightly decreased	Other				Other	They have stayed the same	Yes	10-39%	0			It's impossible to generalise.

For example asking me for a standard ebook royalty rate when I have multiple contracts with a wide range of rates. It also doesn't appear to be comparing like with like: a traditionally published writer might give a low rate, whereas a self-published author might say 50 or 60% or more, but these are very different publishing models - which all appear to be lumped together by that question.	3	1

I'm now working in some awful admin jobs for the NHS and the NIHR and I hate it. I have neither the time nor the inclination to write.	Negative impact	It's just impacted my life generally, we aren't as socially connected, there's not as much going on.

I did a residency I. berlin, and then became Managing Editor, then editor of Ambit.    I applied to Ambit after being published by them in the past, but because the advertising fell from my past gig as arts editor for DJMag which paid £250 a month for three pages and took a good few weeks a month.  I co tributes book reviews to Mu magazine for their first year, recently stopping as it was too much and I realised I couldn’t contribute to literature for free at risk of my own work on top of Ambit which ends up being far beneath minimum wage for the actual work it takes.  I hope to improve this over the next year with grants and increasing sales.	Very positive impact	I loved the silence from outside - not needing to spend money.  It was wonderful.  I wrote a novel.

I also lost a very important contract due to the individual in the partnership being affected by covid and the working partnership was no longer able to continue without them. I had a huge loss of potential earnings and was unable to find secure work.	Negative impact	It has made it difficult to carry out my work causing mental stress and anxiety due to financial worries. It has meant the my perceived growth as a self employed business was unable to go forward and I have felt as though I am starting again. At times this has had a personal affect creating low moods and lack of motivation. I also, due to my leaning difficulties, found it difficult to join online groups and so found myself isolated and struggling to connect during and post covid as lots of meetings and networking has moved online. 	0	Never		No confidence	1	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Traditional publication	Costs of printing, unpaid time putting artwork and collecting pieces together, unpaid time marketing and promoting. 	1	0			0			0		Other						Don't know		0			Na	Na		Female	35-44	White	2	Masters	1	E	SE20		As a fairly new writer there were subjects around contractual matters that I don't have the experience of and so whilst useful to see areas that others might be affected by it would be useful to have the option to skip ahead in questions that aren't relevant.		1

It also meant that I had a good number of readers waiting for the books, which I packaged up and sent out (or distributed electronically via Book Funnel) once they were ready. I wasn’t able to do as much marketing in terms of book lunch and live appearances as I did with the first book (because of lockdown).

My earnings from freelance work were already very small. The mental impact has been mixed. 	Positive impact	I've marked positive because in one way, the enforced isolation has driven me to revisit projects that I care deeply about but had abandoned. There is no guarantee that they will 'earn' me anything in material terms, but their psychological and emotional importance for me personally are huge.   Other positives have come about by having access to on-line resources that are designed to encourage writers, reading a lot, and having access to a community where people talk to each other and are very creative.    The negative effect has been an increased sense of self-pity, hopelessness and worthlessness, being already 'out on a limb' (ie far from big cities, cultural stimulus including libraries), and already officially a pensioner, therefore at the end of the road and of no use to anyone.   	0	Never		Less confident	0	Don't know	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Other	In the past three years, I've been making and posting videos to YouTube.

Negative impact	This is difficult to weigh because I've been lucky enough to have time to write and have written a lot for my blog, online magazines and academic journals, but these are largely unpaid pursuits.

I have also lost work as a proofreader for European academics as it's easier and cheaper for many to work with English speakers in the US now. Also the government's financial schemes were inaccessible to many freelance and self-employed writers. The lack of resources, income and the sheer anxiety of the whole situation has been detrimental to many of us who were just scraping by as it was.		1

Sales are definitely down, and as publications that previously offered review coverage or literary essays close, it's hard not to feel this is an ongoing trend.

Weakened	Female	55-64	White	2	Degree	1	E	SW19		I do not think the rates that authors get paid reflect their knowledge and experience. Rates rarely increase but the workload increases; I'm often asked to do picture research for example. I'm often asked to 'consult' on books which means a salaried editor (with no specialist knowledge) or a 'famous person' writes a book (full of basic errors and facts gleaned from the internet without references) and I am paid a piddling sum (perhaps just £200) to check it all and supply corrections with fully researched references. This is becoming more common, rather than just commissioning me, or someone like me (with the knowledge to get it right first time) to produce the text. 		1

Costs are nil given that internet is a household bill. I tried more conventional book publishing before that but promotion was the ball buster.After 20 years as a poet on the road, I had no desire to return to self promotion and have instead found a kind or writing/publishing that simply lets the writing do the talking. No need to advertise. Wish I'd had this facility as a young poet. Too old really now to make best use of it but am a contented old fart nevertheless!	0	1	1-9%	Stayed the same	0			0		Other						No		0			Mainly I avoid contract work. Best working for myself.	Never trust a Tory is the only maxim I work by. Attempts to control or limit what I write have never been acceptable to me.This works best when I work with a professional editor of course. Only done that once or twice in my 40 year long career. I spent a great deal of early writing career giving my writing away for free. Still the best way to be a professional and enjoy it!

I come from banker and bookmaker stock and have also worked in both and that is where I think money belongs. Only money a writer really needs is the basic subsistence amount. So speaks a poet who has brought up three children on his professional earnings. With the help of a partner for the first two children. The third child was raised on my earnings alone. Never much. Always enough. The work the ALCS does is greatly revered however. But it is the act of writing itself that is the life force. Money is of little to no consequence.		1

This was because of poor health and needing to rebuild my life. During the past two years, I have built a decent self-employed business, as I can afford to work from home and rent alone in South Yorkshire. The pandemic gave me an opportunity to gradually get better - being diagnosed as autistic in February 2020. I had no meetings or pressure from the DWP/Jobcentre between March 2020 and October 2021. This gave me the time and space to slowly rebuild my life, meaning I was declared gainfully self employed by the DWP.

Positive impact	It opened up the writing community to me. I was able to be in contact with writers all over the world, attending far more workshops and meeting more people than I would have otherwise. This revitalised my practice and allowed me to feel very supported. However, the stress of the pandemic in its later stages, when the rules became harder to interpret, increased my stress and anxiety levels and made writing far more difficult. I wrote far less after the initial six months of covid. 	0	Never		Less confident	0	Yes	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Other						No		0						Female	35-34	White	1	Masters	1	E	BN3				1

I don't do conferences any more, don't write or mark GCSE papers since 2017, but leave to younger folk these joys.

Twenty years ago they didn't worry if they didn't cover unpopular options, or, paid a fee for those books on which they tried out new authors. Ten years ago the fee arrangement was more common, but shared royalty schemes were growing. This isn't all bad for authors - the one writing a depth study on Alfred the Great will get more money (but takes a real risk on the quality of the key books in the series, like the Nazi Germany depth study. For experienced and successful authors such a me, who usually write on of the key books in the series, is has considerably reduced my earnings.

It is usually possible to add NC and/or ND by negotiation but academics are increasingly encouraged to publish CC-BY, which, in the humanities and social sciences, allows misrepresentation of one's work, quoting/citing out of context as well as commercial publishers making money from one's work without permission or recompense.   I haven't seen ALCS take up this issue - it bothers academics far more than what we earn from writing (which is a pittance).

People wanted to communicate more. My earnings increased by over 10% as a result.	Negative impact	This is a hard question to answer because Covid-19 had a positive impact on my earnings. I am not sure it benefitted me personally though. I have felt cut off from contacts and made fewer visits to London. Also, I probably overworked at times. I wonder if potentially it will have a negative impact going forwards because of the impact on networking and also clients moving to different jobs after reevaluating their lives.

Most poetry books are sold at readings. My book was also caught in Bertrams folding with the loss of royalties from sales not passed back to the publisher. Copies of my book had been distributed to bookshops on a sale or return basis and the bookshops that closed and didn't have a webstore returned the books anyway despite not giving them chance to sell.	Positive impact	My writing productivity stayed the same. Although not being able to do live poetry readings did impact book sales, being able to do online events (Zoom, Facebook, YouTube, etc) opened opportunities to participate in readings held in Australia, Canada and venues in the UK I wouldn't normally be able to travel to. I also review and was overwhelmed with review requests because poets realised reviews were a good way to keep news of their books in circulation with venues shut.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0			None		Not changed	Female	45-54	White	1	University entry	1	E	LE7				1

My travel costs have also reduced due to a relocation to a city with better research resources, so not all of the change is down to Covid.		It's a bit early to say. When I found my social life completely cancelled in lockdown (I live alone) I spent some time experimenting with a book in a new genre. If this sells, then I'm going to say that's a very positive impact! If it doesn't, I think the experience will. still have a positive effect on my wider writing career. On the other hand, the pandemic has meant having to completely reschedule research and writing on my main contracted book: I'm lucky that I haven't had to move deadlines because I was at the beginning of a writing cycle with time to spare, but it hasn't been ideal.	1	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1			1	0		1	Substantially increased	Other	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%		They have stayed the same	No		0					Improved	Female	45-54	White	1	PhD	1	E	M1				1

Negative impact	Massively decreased productivity due to stress and anxiety, especially in 2020.

A clause in my contract was changed: "Our proposal for the future is to set the royalty for print books to 12% of net sales receipts (money we’ve received) for printed books. By ‘net sales receipts’ I mean money we have received for sales, less returns and discounts, but completely ignoring our costs." Before, the publisher offered 14% royalties over their net benefice. I think the 2% royalty cuts should have been properly negotiated, and the advantages/disadvantages properly discussed, before this was put in place.

No impact	I was fortunately enough to sign with another publisher during the Covid-19 pandemic, but this wasn't because of Covid-19, so all in all it hasn't had a significant impact. The stress I suffered was due to the writing deadline, but this has had a positive outcome because I now have a new book out and a potential for a higher writing income in next tax year.	0	Yes, as a matter of course	Professional body/union	Moderately confident	0	Don't know	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	Putting a self-published Christmas book on Kindle was relatively easy. I engaged a freelance editor and cover artist before I published it, costing me £200 (mate rates), and I paid a blog tour organisor £65 for a week-long blog tour to help me market the book. So far, the book hasn't made enough to cover the costs of production. I think it drowned in a crowded Christmas ebook market.	1	0			1	1	1	1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			My previous publisher offered me a contract for a book, which was a very restrictive contract, and on taking advice from the Society of Authors, I decided not to sign with them again and instead self-publish the book.

On advice from the Society of Authors I decided not to sign a restrictive contract, which would essentially have tied me to them indefinitely.

Had the pandemic not happened, I would have expected my earnings to increase substantially from these workshops and events.  My husband was also made redundant and is currently re-training also contributing to our overall loss of earnings. 	Negative impact	Homeschooling my kids meant less time for work - and at a point when the youngest had just started nursery so the extra time I anticipated having for work evaporated.

I wrote more books but I've done that in other years when there wasn't a pandemic, so any increased productivity was simply due to more time to write and to me wanting to make more money.

With disruption to teaching, it seemed that students were not buying books. My main textbook, however, has a companion website that would be helful in these circumstances. I am perhaps unusual, and I have no contacts with other writers, so I do not know there experiences. I should add that my publisher was taken over by another company in June 2021. There were problems with my former publisher paying my royalties. Therefore, the reduced royalties I received in the autumn of 2021 seemed to reflect this situation. 	Negative impact	It was very stressful. I suffer from stress anyway. The changing of publisher was also stressful. The publishers tend to treat authors like me simply as service or goods suppliers, not as part of their organization.  These are major publishers who need to behave in decent ways to retain authors. Authors are not like employees, who were transferred automatically in a takeover. I was kept in the dark about whether the book I am currently writing would be taken up by the new publisher.  It was, but it was months before a contract came through. The anxiety caused the flare-up of a medical condition which I suffer from (I have attacks that last 2-3 days, and I can't work). I got tablets for these in the summer of 2020, and I have been much better since then. 	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	Yes	1	1	1	No.  I succeeded in getting a change of terms on payment of royalties twice a year, rather than once a year.

He put his name on the cover of this book as the author, even though it included my chapters. And he listed the book on his CV with himself as the author. My publisher refused to do anything about this. I blamed my editor for this, and asked for a new editor, as relations had broken down. This did not happen. I hope my new publisher would not allow this kind of thing to happen.	Basically, neglect by the publisher. I get no timely answers to queries, sometimes no answer at all.  My feeling has been that, as they are working at home, they are not really keeping track of things.	No, not quite. I was so relieved to receive a contract at all, that I just accepted it.

The financial impact will actually be felt more in 21/22, because I am used to being paid on publication, often a year after delivering features. Lack of travel means that magazines don't have my usual stock of material, for which I would gradually be paid.	No impact	I've marked 'no impact' because the pandemic has had both positive and negative impacts that have balanced out.

I work from home, so I have no costs in terms of commuting, buying lunches out or other associated expenses.  Since then, I've almost doubled my earnings from 2020.	Very positive impact	I launched myself freelance last year, and I've grown in skills, confidence and experience. Clients seek me out, not the other way around. I have a unique skillset — a PhD, background in journalism, and a focus in HR technology. Since quitting my full-time job I get to pick only the projects I love doing, and the clients I want to work with.	0	Never		No confidence	0	Don't know	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			1	No change									0						Female	35-44	White	2	PhD	1	E	E9				0

My first book was published in February 2020. It and its sequels did very well, but could have done better if the ecosystem of schools and libraries and bookshops had been open. Word of mouth would have given them an opportunity to spread further. I also did not benefit from conducting school visits or attending most festivals. This would have raised my profile and earned me income. But, that said, my income remained relatively stable as I was supported by delivery advances for contracted books.	Negative impact	I have done quite well considering, but the pandemic closures meant I lost a lot of the opportunities I would have had as a debut author to attend events, meet people and make connections to further my career. Two years later and I have yet to attend a book function and have met very few of my peers in person. It's less fun. Less sociable. More stressful and insular. I have also found it much harder to be creative with little ability to travel or do research in person.	1	Never		Less confident	1	No	0	1	1	I asked a publication date to be put back as the stress of our deadlines was too much.

I have a refused and always will, preferring not to write for those publications. These days I focus my book writing on America, now having a US agent and main publisher. I find the UK publishing industry hardly worth bothering with, so they have become an afterthought. UK TV and radio is still significant though.	I think royalties on ebooks are too low.	Weakened	Male	55-64	White	2	Degree	1	Other		1	The ability to earn a living from writing anything other than TV has grown far worse since 2008 and the dominance of advertising by tech companies. Amazon have driven down the price of books, while magazines and newspapers pay very poorly, with the result that freelance writing has all but disappeared. The boom in newsletters may help, if it sustains. My fear is that only people from wealthy backgrounds will now be able to get a foothold in the profession: someone from my background would find it hard to get established now. There were many more routes in when I began - though it was still hard to get through even then.		1

For example, in a UK based book it is acceptable to say the Universe started with the Big Bang - the generally accepted scientific concept. This idea is not acceptable to a large number of people in the USA  because of their religious beliefs.   Publishers have also reduced the number of books given to authors on publication. In the 1980s, 90s and 2000s the rule was 6 copies of each edition. It is now usual to be offered one copy of he first edition only. 		Weakened	Female	65-74	White	3	Masters	1	E	S11		As a writer and someone who has written for around 40 years and is now old enough not to rely on my yearly author's income, I write when I want to rather than when asked by a publisher.  I feel your questionnaire takes no notice of the fact that  1. writers can refuse jobs - I do so regularly 2. there are people like me who categorise themselves as retired even though we continue to earn income from the odd bit of writing, and from books written years ago 3. as a writer I have always made a reasonable amount of money as a consultant - reading other people's books on behalf of a publisher to check a book's content, facts and their interpretation. 'Consultant' didn't seem to feature in your money-making options.		1

I am technically "published" by an American Independent Publisher, however, they provide me with the finished files and I upload these to the publishing platform. The publisher is named in the book Metadata and deals with all the registrations, etc. So, while I am, in a sense, self-publishing, it is not quite as that is generally understood.		1

I have a band of beta readers and editors who are happy to be rewarded with a copy of the finished book. I design my own covers and do all my own formatting. It means I can publish a book from start to finish in less than a year - far quicker than traditional publishers. I agree that marketing is a problem - I don't do any because my passion is writing, not selling myself. (I would have to sell myself if I had a traditional publisher). Despite this my books sell moderately well and, in fact, one of the non-fiction books is recommended as a course book at a USA University. It costs me nothing to publish my books through Amazon kdp and they have an excellent support team who rectify printing or book display issues immediately.

But Covid definitely cut down on the kind of work that was available to me. I earn money as a public speaker and many of the events where I could have spoken were initially cancelled for a while. Also, my partner (whom I did not meet until 2019) lost his job in May 2021, which has created an added pressure financially, especially as we have a young child. 	Negative impact	I would not say it is a huge impact in either direction, but it has been very isolating -- which some might see as a good situation to be in, if you're trying to get work done. Mainly it is the loss of in-person events, which means a certain loss in community -- something fairly vital for lonely occupations like writing. This has made it harder to network and to maintain connections and find support as a writer. 	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Agent	Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1			1	0		1	Substantially increased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0					Improved	Female	45-54	Black	3	Masters	1	E	BA12				1

During the first lockdown...  * A colleague tragically died of COVID-19. Obviously, this was completely devastating - and a commissioned project a large group of us had been working on, and which had been scheduled for the autumn of 2020, was abandoned.  * A regular television show, which I work on every year, was postponed as one of the other writer/performers was shielding.   * My role in assisting stand-up comedians with theatre shows was immediately redundant once the Edinburgh Festival was cancelled.   * Existing radio work, crafted to be performed in front of an audience, had to be re-written in such a way that it could be recorded a) remotely and b) without an audience. This meant a considerable amount of extra work on three radio series - all of which went unpaid.   * Potential work was lost when television companies delayed or abandoned their commissioning rounds and processes.   Fortunately, I did qualify for the SEISS grant, which went some way to helping with the loss of income.	Very negative impact	Aside from the loss of income from cancelled projects (which for me, personally, runs into tens of thousands of pounds) - it's worth noting the general loss of momentum I, and many of my colleagues, feel we have suffered during the pandemic.   Projects being pitched to TV companies were immediately dropped as broadcasters, understandably, had to rethink how they spent money during the pandemic.   It felt like there was a certain (and again, understandable) reluctance by indies or broadcasters to commit to larger projects as the year went on. Many of us who assist stand-up comedians with their live work were also hit by the cancellation of the Edinburgh Festival.  My radio background was certainly useful when it came to picking-up bits of work on the shows and formats which could continue - but what work was about did seem relatively small and piecemeal in comparison to 2019.   The idea of writers benefiting from some sort of "increased productivity" while locked-away during the pandemic is a bit of a romantic one. Maybe there was a small amount of freedom in having the time to write-up that idea you always wanted to... But who was in a position to buy your work? The uncertainty made it quite difficult.  2022 has got off to a slightly better start for me personally, but we shall have to wait and see what transpires and how long it takes for the industry to truly pick itself up.	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Agent	Moderately confident	1	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Other	Was invited onto a podcast project and it felt like a good time (while work was somewhat thin on the ground) to give it a go.	1	1	10-39%	Stayed the same	1	0	0	1	No change							Don't know		0			In comedy it is common to by paid directly by a comic for assistance with material ahead of a TV or Radio show panel game appearance. No credit is given and none is expected. This is a tale as old as time.  HOWEVER, since 2020 I have done work on narrative TV shows (sitcoms etc) on a day-rate in which I have been paid directly by a production company on the understanding I will not receive a credit. Maybe I am naive but, personally, this was unheard of 5 or 6 years ago.		Weakened	Male	35-44	White	2	Masters	1	E	W3		Yes I have a few concerns about the questions.  Question 10 - "All figures should be based on earnings BEFORE tax and should exclude any agent's fees"  My question here is did you want my GROSS or NET earnings? It really isn't clear. The way you phrase it suggests (to me) NET  - As that is usually what people mean when they "earnings before tax". (It's what I usually associate with "what my mortgage company want to know").   However, if you then compare my NET earnings with my writing income, it's a very disingenuous calculation - because my writing income will be a raw number representing "money in" - Effectively, GROSS writing earnings. So it will not include deductions for expenses etc.  which the NET figure will. So you're really not comparing like-with-like.   The overall effect of this is that our writing incomes will always appear to be a larger % than they actually are.   For what it is worth, I did mine as GROSS income and then full writing earnings which is, I believe, mathematically sound - although I don't know how many others will make the same call and will therefore give some potentially confusing and incorrect results.   Also, in a subsequent question you used the phrase "Publishers". Did this also include "Broadcasters"? I do not work in print at all, really - all my work is on radio and TV. As such, I left this as zero, but otherwise this could have been the bulk of my earnings.		1

This comes to an end October 2022 and things will be very different – anticipating a sudden and dramatic dip in my income.	Positive impact	As above, I have been fortunate in having paid work since the pandemic.  But I have found working online quite stressful, even though it has made the social engagement work possible and extended its reach, ditto readings and teaching etc.  I have continued working on my own writing and have appreciated being more home-based, with less travel breaking up my routine.  Again, there's a paradox here –  I've missed the social contact that comes from leading workshops and giving and attending readings.    So, a real mix of benefits and disadvantages.  Longer term, it doesn't feel sustainable though – we do need more in person human contact and a sense of a shared future.	0	Never		Less confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			1	No change	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0			Not a lot of experience in this area this past year.

However, this is because I had produced a new title, incurring initial  costs of editor, cover designer, printer and ebook conversion. I also had to pay for reprints of existing titles, one of which has sold over 8,000 copies.  Overall my profits from my most successful self-published titles are far more lucrative than royalties.  So far (over several years) my most commercial title has earned c. 10x the amount I would have expected from conventionally published royalties, for just 2x the amount of work.  I do put considerable efforts into promotion and marketing - which means I have total control over what happens with my books.  My most recent self published book garnered glowing full length reviews in 2 major national journals.   I have no problem in getting bookshops to stock my self published books, which look exactly the same as books produced by conventional publishers, with strong covers.    The key is to understand how the book trade works before embarking on self publishing and to act in a totally professional way throughout.  	1	1			1	1	1	1	Slightly increased	Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have gone up	No		1	Both attribution and integrity	Pearson wished to re-use a story I wrote some years ago for one of their primary school reading schemes.  The re-use was in an anthology.    The original contract did not cover this form of re-use so we had to negotiate a fee.  they originally offered me a pittance of £110.    I refused to accept this and thought that would be the end of it, but they subsequently increased it to £500.  They then sent me an addendum to the original contract, which contained a clause saying I waived all my moral rights for this re-use.  Again, I refused to accept it.  Eventually they re-drafted the addendum saying that this clause was deleted, and specifying that I would be credited as author in all editions of this re-use.  Pearson are a nightmare to deal with, they keep sending me crazy bureaucratic forms and their IT system makes it very difficult to sign and submit things online.  Since this re-use was for an anthology, I fear other, less experienced, authors may have been exploited for it in a way that I refused to be. 	See above.

I am a lawyer and make sure that I look at all clauses which will hopefully be in my favour. My publishers (Routledge) tell me that I am mostly the only author who changes or amends terms of the publishing contract. I try and negotiate better royalties in percentage terms; I try and get as many free copies (hardback and paperback) as I can. I look carefully at the e-copies of the book in terms of royalties. The clauses which are the most contentious are the ones - if there is legal action - such as being sued in defamation - the publishers will not normally assist the author in a legal action. You are on your own. This is most important that authors read these clauses. I also never agree to doing my own indexing or images/ tables. As part of the contract I get the publishers to do this for me since this would take an extraordinary amount of time.	0	1	1	1	0	0	1	1	1			0	0			1	1	1	1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have gone up	No		0			None so far other than signing contracts online / virtually	No. I make sure that this does not arise at the start for reasons I have explained.

Negative impact	Initially was in fear, pervasive generalised fear. I could not see this virus... I have discovered that I gain vitality through meeting people with a similar set off interests.  It affected the starting of things, I literally lost my drive. It felt like someone had removed my internal battery and gave me two AA batteries to function on.  It felt like a depression, but it was not, as whenever I could get near a scrap of my own normal life, I felt my energy rising. I never realised how symbiotically connected I am to the world and people around me. I could not write when in fear, I felt a disgust and lethargy to commencing something.  When I made public appearances or talks, I found my thinking style had become black/white, all/nothing, grey, lacking my normal creativity and blue sky thinking had been shot in the proverbial when attempting flight. My libido plummeted, as I felt impotent in the world, I did not feel like I was affecting anything, ineffective, useless. I found myself at the age of 52 becoming obsessed with my pension plan, which is crazy. I spent hours planning my life in 15 years time, hours and hours, listening to work whilst lying on my bed.  The emperor's new clothes, my childhood favourite book was now playing live in front of me. I was so filled with futile anger and angst that it dried me of any creation. I sometimes played the part of the agreeable fool like everyone else, agreeing that zoom meetings were so helpful, whilst my feet and hands got colder.  My body locking down, my mind seeking escape; I do hope that it is all nearly over. I figured out on the weekend that I am actually now frightened of having hope, that feeling hope makes my corpus tense and I cried with self and other compassion, large globular tears that could refresh a humming bird.	0	Never		Less confident	1	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Other				Other	They have gone down	No		0			None really	none	Not changed	Male	45-54	White	5 or more	PhD	1	Other		1	I have found writing my responses very helpful, it has quietened and allowed me to express my fears and concerns	3	1

My earnings are more in the most recent tax year because my most recent books (ebooks, digital publisher) were paying quarterly royalties, which weren't coming through in 2019-2020. Lucky enough to help run a family business, so monthly salary from that (and the business was deemed essential so could operate through lockdown)	No impact	There have been pros and cons. The first lockdown coincided with a three-book contract so I was able to dedicate time to writing, but as my working life (family business) is flexible I can take time out to write anyway. Lack of social life did help with the daily word count though! I'd say there was a level of stress, but only a part of that was the existential 'we're all doomed' pandemic sort of stress. The real stress has been self-inflicted in that we sold our house and can't find one to buy... although we have a roof over our heads, being 'stateless' doesn't help with peace of mind!	1			No confidence	0	Don't know	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0		1	No change	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	40-59%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I don't think my contracts have changed (have just resigned another three-book deal contract and I think it's the same as the one I signed in 2019) My agent looks over the contracts though, so I might not know all the ins and outs		Not changed	Female	35-44	White	2	Degree	1	E	GU				1

I looked to enhance my income elsewhere and started my own business as a freelance editor. Whilst this has been successful, I have seen my book sales suffer, as a result of not being able to showcase them in schools. Starting a new business and focusing on other writers' work has also had an impact on my own productivity. During Covid, I have also seen a long delay between signing my next book deal and publication - in fact, the book I was signed for has been shelved and I am now working on a new title, pushing my next publication date from 2022 to 2024 - a four-year gap since my last book. Writing was also difficult during the early stages of Covid, as I was homeschooling, which took away a great deal of my ability to focus and create and therefore produce saleable content.	Negative impact	Covid hit just as my second book was released - everything I had looked forward to, in terms of promoting my series, was cancelled - the launch, publicity, and most importantly, school visits. I have managed to squeeze a couple in between lockdowns but without the ability to do multiple visits, each feels like the first one again - stressful and anxiety-inducing! In the beginning, there was a panicked rush to provide content online, to maintain a presence, to feel relevant, and this was overwhelming.  Just prior to the first lockdown I signed a new 2-book deal, which was initially put on hold, and then the book in question was shelved. This was entirely due to the pandemic and obviously caused not only stress, but a further delay in my career. In lieu of books on the shelves and author events to promote them, I have had to look for alternative income streams, all of which take away from writing. I have also had to homeschool two children, and manage their concerns, none of which is conducive to being creative!

Producing audiobooks is very expensive because you have to pay the narrator and the return on sales is low because many audiobooks are sold on a subscription basis. Ebooks provide the most profit but even there, many people have subscriptions with Amazon that mean they get so many free books each month. The number of books sold at 0.99 and given away for free has escalated recently, in my opinion. The unpaid time required for marketing, publishing your book and self-promotion far outweighs the time spent in writing.	0	0			0			0		Other	0-19%	40-59%	60-79%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0					Not changed	Female	75-84	White	1	Degree	1	Other		1	No		1

No charge made.  Later this year I plan to self-publish a 500 page book, being an annotated compilation or articles published in a magazine over 20 years, of which I own the copyright by agreement with the publisher. There will be a small number of copies in paper form, with the main circulation in electronic form (possibly Kindle though I have not decided that finally).  I have not yet decided on price or conditions, but the main motivation is the maximum possible readership, not to make a financial profit (and possibly not even to recover costs). All the writing and formatting will be done by me, and I will commission a publisher specialising in vanity books to do the physical production of the paper versions. (For guidance, the maximum readership of the paper plus electronic formats will be, I guess, about 100, and I will be happy with half that).	1	1	1-9%	Stayed the same	0			1	Substantially decreased	Other						No		0			For magazine articles, I used t receive a fixed sum per article.

It's increasingly hard to keep afloat from pure writing, which is why I've branched out into TV. I think there's a lack of respect for freelancers in terms of paying them on time too.

He was at least 12 hours working online every day, and I helped with breaks and meals. I also took on looking after my mother who has early-stage dementia.

Initial advance and contract was with The Women's Press and they went out of business before my non-fiction book was published.  Currently I'm completing a children's non-fiction book (though I've ticked the 'educational' box above as there is loads of super-accurate science in it - but the purpose is to be fun) with materials scientists from the University of Leeds. I received  a flat fee and the books will be given out for free in areas of the city that are poorest, possibly via libraries or schools or foodbanks. because of that I'm not worried about lack of royalties. It is 'collaborative' and will be illustrated, but none of the others are writers.

Like doing a tax retunr. I nearly stopped but I'm autistic and like to complete things I've started, so you were lucky there. You might have asked if income matches expenditure. Not quite the happiness index but the sense of security we all need. Our combined income looks low but we are house -rich. We have paid off mortgages on two properties and live in one and rent out the other. This is why my partner was safe to early retire and why I am looking at leaving employment soon through ill health.  (I also get PIP  high mobility and low care benefit which is around 300 a month, but I did not include this in our household income as it is NOT subject to tax. But obvs I can use it to pay the bills).		1

As the pandemic went on, I was offered a number of on-line speaking gigs, and also took on private on-line teaching, and a second book commission.  I also was able to increase the amount of book reviewing I do which helped keep my overall income roughly stable. 	Negative impact	The pandemic messed with the delicate eco-system of my writing life. It significantly increased the stress, anxiety and isolation of being a freelance writer and dramatically decreased the enjoyable (and necessary) perks such as literary festivals events, public speaking engagements, IRL teaching, and general opportunities for meeting like-minded people. 	0	Yes, sometimes	Other	Moderately confident	0	Don't know	0	1	1	I successfully negotiated text and cover approval,  and the retention of adaptation and audio rights, and sub-licensing approval.  I was not successful in reserving translation rights.   I was also prevented from accepting an offer from Bloomsbury for a book that was already under contract with a charity that planned to self-publish, even though I was advised informally by a lawyer that the charity was in breach of the principle of estoppel.  I couldn't afford legal representation and didn't have an agent at the time with the result that the charity was able to block the offer from Bloomsbury (and is currently making a total hash of self-publishing!) 	0	1	1	0	0	0	1	1	0				0			1	0		1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Other	They have stayed the same	No		0			It has become harder to negotiate terms.

Weakened	Female	55-64	Other	1	Degree	1	E	OX4		I had a contract for a book suddenly cancelled in early 2018 for reasons which were never properly explained or justified.  I felt I had no say in this decision, which came at a very difficult time in my life personally and was a huge blow to my confidence and finances.  What was particularly odd was that the publisher had just  paid me 25% of the advance a few weeks before they cancelled the whole contract.  I believe the reasons for cancelling were primarily ideological but have no way of proving this.  My then agent did not fight the cancellation but did negotiate that I should pay back the 25% received when /if I ever sold the book for more than £20k. 		1

The stress was incredible and  not something I would like to go through again. There were far too many headless chickens squawking about what had to be done and an insane expectation that we were suddenly au fait with systems we'd never used before, such as Teams, Loom etc.   The publisher I used has a model of expecting authors to be really pushy and do a lot of their own marketing. This is fine if you are a. gregarious, outgoing and a bit of a show off and b. not in full-time employment!  They do do some marketing for you, set up interviews and so on but a lot is down to the author. I had a book come out in the middle of the pandemic lockdown and it all fell - and felt - a bit flat.Sad really.	No impact	Stress levels through the roof -  mainly because it feels we are lead by a bunch of blind, soft nellies at a national level.  Just expected to get on with it, whilst being expected to support every other person and their dog. Sick to  death of hearing about 'mental health' - all that will do is create a crisis. Amazing how kids in the past came through wars, accidents, other extremes and just picked up and got on with it.

The publisher had to shift the pub date back from April to November in the UK, and bookstore/festival closures meant that I was unable to do public events. Excerpts planned to run in national press were cancelled to make space either for COVID coverage, or for 'lighter' topics (I write natural history with a focus on extinction). This was the worst possible outcome for a debut writer, particularly one who is attempting to get a foothold in the UK. I am a dual Australian/British national and I spend about 4-6 months each year in London, but in 2020 I was stranded by the Australian government's international travel restrictions in the UK for much longer than anticipated (an additional 6 months), with tailing income because of a loss of teaching I ordinarily do in the second half of the year in Sydney. I was lucky in the sense that I had a book in the market, and the final portion of my advance payment was timed with the pub date — so that lump sum saw me through. But I feel that the book's sales in the UK were much, much flatter than they might otherwise have been. In 2021 a "highly commended" in the Wainwright prize bought some visibility, along with a strong BBC interview. But we're still not where we could have been. 	Negative impact	In all frankness (!): Decreased productivity and anxiousness, yes. My partner is a playwright and we were separated from one another in different countries by border closures for some 2020: he also saw his income plummet. The initial period of the pandemic saw a flurry of activity and thought — I thought I was well positioned to write in this moment. But then I started overblowing deadlines (I write critical reviews for large print magazines; in 2020/21 The Guardian, The Atlantic and in Australia, The Monthly) and letting editors down, and though I was spending hours at the desk I had no fluency. I was incredibly ashamed of the lack of professionalism. I was paralysed by the fear of getting the virus for a time — I was living in a London borough with the highest death rate in the country — and I was sure that I would not be able to get to my parents if they got sick (they're in Perth, WA). I had a mild depressive episode, and needed to see a psychologist to re-stabilize. I had not yet built up enough of a writing community in London to have peers to lean on or for solidarity, and my Australian community were going through a very different texture of experience in terms of the COVID waves and variants. 	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Agent	Very confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I signed my first book contract in 2013, with a mid-tier publisher in Australia. The contract was short and included world rights. The advance was very small.   I got an agent in 2018, and — via a side letter off setting US/North American rights to that agent — signed a contract in the US with a top tier publisher in 2019. That contract was more comprehensive, and for considerably more money. My Australian publisher sought to have their UK outlet produce the British edition of the book. That book was published in 2020 (hardback) / 2021 (paperback).   My second book contract was signed in 2021; with my existing Australian and US publishers, and with a new mid-tier UK publisher. The advance in the US was lower, but the advance in the UK and Australia was higher — the total is roughly equivalent to what I received for my first book, but the amounts are parcelled up differently (one on signing, one of partial submission, one on completed m/s, one on publication of hardback, one on publication of paperback). These contracts were all negotiated by my agent, who is US-based. 	Not with publishers, no, but with teaching organisations. Especially where teaching orgs seek rights over written materials produced in the course of delivering a workshop series; or record lectures/talks to repackage and re-deliver to participants in future offerings, without further payment to the author/teacher. I learnt to be especially live to these circumstances. 	Improved	Female	35-44	White	2	PhD	1	Other		1	Thank you for compiling this data!		1

I have a small publishing company and would like to convert all my titles into ebooks but have repeatedly found I've been unable to create epub files. There don't seem to be adequate guides on this around and I wonder if this is a large part of the reason why ebooks are not as popular as had been initially predicted - i.e. many titles aren't available as ebooks as publishers haven't managed to work out how to produce them (really)! I'm usually very good with technology and all kinds of software so this is perplexing me.		1

All promised commissioned for the year ahead of the 6 episode show were cancelled and no guarantees were made about who would receive what work. Any in person teaching, workshops etc were cancelled. My stage play at the time was due to have a reading in the first May Covid hit and a production around about now - but the reading happened winter 2021 and now the production is likely to be around 2023. I secured an episode on a flagship, primetime television show, which I have experience in but have been trying to break back into after some time away - but the entire Covid impact on the show meant the process for me as a first time writer was riddled with incidents that would not ordinarily have happened and resulted in the episode being taken back and handed to an experienced hand to complete. The head of the show called me to give me the (bad) news - and admitted that had there not been the pressures of covid, mine and other episodes in the block would have had a little more time to iron out an issues, but with covid impact on filming and production, they were having to take the most straight forward and quick path - passing the episode to someone else. There were two other stage projects that I had which were cancelled due to the impact of covid on theatre and small theatre companies.	Negative impact	Writing is an isolated job - and most writers know that and enjoy that - but it is crucial to have some human interaction with one's fellow peers or production teams. I fear that with Zoom, much as it can benefit those who can't get away from home so easily, the cost benefits to production teams may mean writers are further side-lined and tucked away in a corner from the rest of the team who make a show.  Opportunities for newer voices in any ongoing programme in any medium is more of a risk (or seen that way) and production teams are leaning on experienced people and steering clear of anyone who may have a passion and a talent for writing, but challenging home lives. This is a tragedy, as often such are the voices with real insight into the human condition.  I went for two of the available SIESS grants - and they helped us get through as my partner was out of work for 7 months this year just gone. But given the tax bill I face, I would probably rather have faced the challenges of not having the grant, that raised the tax bill anyway.	1	Yes, sometimes	Professional body/union	Less confident	1	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1	1-9%	Increased	1	0	0	0		Other						No		0				The most recent contract I signed - like others - practically may as well say "we agree to conceded nothing in exchange for everything from the writer". when one is involved at the development stage of a project that may go on to be made for years and years and be sold elsewhere and for repeats, it is really difficult that we haven't found a way in which writers and creatives can be fairly remunerated for the input which ends up being part of a show - but very cleverly ownership of those ideas "shared" by all - so no one has to pay you for your vital contribution. 	Not changed	Female	45-54	Black	3	Degree	1	E	B27		I believe that more needs to be done to involve and educate writers in negotiations and agents in supporting writers in those negotiations.  I also believe companies ought to pay the agent's fee or part of it, as they benefit more from an agent pairing them with a writer that fits a project. I believe development people from all companies ought to be the ones who travel to other parts of Britain (outside London) in order to connect with regional creatives, as opposed to freelance writers having to take the cost of a whole day out of work and travel and expenses to 'meet' a development person from a production company for what's usually half any hour, if that. If the companies can't pay the writer's expenses to meet with them, then they ought to pay for their development people to travel out and meet writers in the regions.		1

I pay a virtual assistant to do some of the technical stuff and to keep things moving while I am away. I buy cover design and interior formatting when self-publishing.

Prior to 2018, when I signed with a new traditional publisher, my career was in the doldrums and I struggled to make a living. My responses then would have been very different from what they are now. E-books and Amazon KDP Select have made a tremendous difference to author earnings. It is possible to make a living and better now.		1

That doesn't seem to be the case any more.	Yes, I didn't realise until my novel was optioned by a film company that it was not the norm for the publisher to hold 100% of the rights. Fortunately they gave 50% of the rights back to me in order to get the film deal, but I sense that perhaps if the film maker had not felt strongly about this, they may not have. Similarly with my short story collection, I did not realise until after publication that they not only owned the rights to the collection as a whole, but also to each individual story. I suppose these are the pitfalls of not having an agent, but after spending more than 10 years attempting to find one who would take me on, I fear I am unagentable!

For instance, in 2005 I was paid £1200 for a 2,800 word article; for the same slot today I am paid £1000 and have to file 5,000 words plus source photographs. Sorry but it has long become unsustainable - I genuinely can earn more stacking supermarket shelves or driving a moped now.		1

Secondly, as a German academic I earn part of my money from the German licensing service VG Wort. This normally provides a nice sum of money, but since they do not pay for academic publications that are only available as online sources in German libraries they informed me that I will not get paid for several of my articles that appeared during the pandemic because libraries cancelled their print subscriptions and only kept their digital subscriptions. This will affect my earnings in 2022 and henceforth as long as VG Wort does not change its regulations.	Very negative impact	Apart from the above mentioned issues, the lockdown and the insecurity affected my health (stress-related illnesses that flared up) and it is a cause of constant anxiety that affects my productivity.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	Yes	1	1	1		0	0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0			Publishers include clauses regarding reselling my work without paying part of this money to me as an author.

Very negative impact	I spent time homeschooling my granddaughter, and increased time caring for her so was unable to write. However, since my other job also disappeared, I was able to use the time previously spent working as a writer. I earned nothing at all from my theatre work, and it became harder to send novels to traditional publishers, and those that did accept submissions took a long time to reply.  When not caring for the child, I was able to write with fewer interruptions, as people were not expecting me to socialise or go out to meet them and there were fewer demands on my time.	0	Never		Very confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1		Decreased	1	1	0	0		Percentage of net receipts	0-19%		40-59%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0					Improved	Female	55-64	White	3	University entry	1	E	TN6				1

For my husband, this meant his hours decreased significantly simply due to availability, so he was earning less. My journalism was impacted - I was writing fewer articles - and my income from this decreased for the first year of the pandemic by about 50%, but it has picked up again and is about 75% of some of my highest-earning years in journalism. I self-published a book that sold out and did well enough to earn about 4,000 GBP, but this really only covered the publishing costs, and while it was great (!) it was a bit of an outlier in my usual writing income. I do not usually make more than a few hundred pounds per book that is published (perhaps due to usually working with small-press publishers, so the royalties are small). We also spent all of our savings on moving to Australia and buying an house, renovating that house, and we have had a baby, all exciting but expensive!	Negative impact	By and large, my writing hasn't been hugely affected by the pandemic, probably because I have always worked on fairly small scales anyway. My self-published book was hosted by Blackwell's and did very well; it was probably delayed by about a year due to the pandemic, but once it was published, it sold well, so that did not seem to be too affected by the pandemic. However, Blackwell's itself is being sold (devastating) and my book would probably have gone into a second edition with the support of Blackwell's - now, that won't happen. So there is a negative impact.   When the pandemic first hit the UK, my journalism dropped off completely for a few months, and has come back, not to its full extent, but pretty well. Some of that is due to my move oveaseas; I'm writing more book reviews and fewer theatre and museum exhibition reviews (almost all of which used to be London-centric,) because I'm simply not there, which is related to the pandemic, but not the precise cause. 	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	Yes	1		0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Traditional publication	This novel, Ophelia Swam, was supported by Blackwell's, and I would not have self-published it if I did not have that arrangement in place, because effectively Blackwell's acted as my marketing and distribution platform. If I did not have that arrangement, the cost of self-publishing the book would not have been viable. It worked very well and I'm sorry we won't be able to repeat the project. I put about 5k into the initial production of the book (personal funds) which included paying a typesetter and covered printing costs. Then, I had an arrangement with Blackwell's, who bought the books (500 copies) for 40% off the RRP; we agreed the RRP to be beneficial to both them and me. It worked very nicely and reinforced that you can effectively cut out the middle-men if you and the bookseller have a good relationship.	1	0			1	1	1	0		Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			n/a		Improved	Female	35-44	White	3	Masters	1	Other		1	It is interesting to continually fall through the cracks as a freelance writer in terms of government support. For example, I have recently had a baby, and while my husband (a working-from-home contractor,) was considered eligible for paternity leave reimbursement, I was not. This was not due to the amount of incoming I was earning (substantially less than he earns,) but due to working too few hours - effectively, my per-hour income is 'too high' to be considered eligible for maternity leave support. How curious to be penalised for earning a good hourly rate!? 	3	1

I also took a course which helped develop my pitching skills, which helped me secure more and higher paid writing jobs. However, as I felt forced into a permanent role, which often involves 10-12 hour days it's harder to find time to write. Taking on commissions are often very stressful as I have to write around work (late at night, throughout the night and early in the morning) and throughout the weekend.

I have not applied for an HMRC grant to boost income.	Positive impact	Less paid work. More time for personal creative work.  The pandemic has given me more free time and I have written two novels since the first lockdown.

I have requested changes this very morning to a contract, and haven't yet received a reply. This is for various articles across perhaps a year, and comes from a Chinese?US outfit. The contract specified that I would bear bank charges, which I am not happy with, as these will be a significant cut in my fee.

I had a sharp drop-off in freelance work, too, but took on extra teaching and mentoring to cover it. My partner is also freelance and had no work for a while.	Negative impact	For about a year I was very unproductive - anxiety, stress and lack of stimulation. I'm more productive now, but still feel very isolated. I haven't seen my agent or editor in over two years and have never met or even Zoomed with my publicity team. Online events are great, but I feel there's much less opportunity for newer or unknown writers to partake in them as it's big names that attract viewers. I also just miss going to in-person events, hearing and speaking to other writers, feeling creatively stimulated.	1			Less confident	0	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0		1		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			I haven't signed any new contracts in the past year.

However, we did save money by not being able to go out and I got some unexpected freelance work as story consultant and freelance editor.	No impact	I've had to focus less on own writing because of a new family anyway, and one of the reasons I took a paying job was the unpredictability and low reward of writing for publication (as much as it a pleasure to do). As a professional copywriter, the work has got more stressful as we're expect to do more with less. 	1	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1		0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1		Increased	1	0		1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have gone down	Don't know		0						Male	35-44	White	3	Degree	1	E	NR3				1

I have undertaken some work online but my business has yet to recover so I've taken on a PAYE role for two days a week to supplement my income.  My workforce wellbeing book was published in November 2019 and the Publisher was due to connect with Universities and Colleges to promote it with people who were undertaking, for instance business administration courses. I was promoting the book at face-to-face network meetings as well but the pandemic stopped us both from having those interactions and so potentially the sales of the book have been reduced.	Very negative impact	The Publisher was looking to engage with Universities and Colleges which were running business administration, HR and other people management courses, to promote the book and to suggest that they could engage with me to offer advice and guidance to their students.  I've worked in business and management for thirty years and would very much like to support people as they move towards management roles.  I would have enjoyed that work and it could have been a positive income stream for me but the pandemic stopped the interaction of the Publisher and my attempts to engage with educational organisations have not been successful.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	0		Percentage of net receipts		0-19%		Other		No		0			None		Weakened	Female	45-54	White	1	Masters	1	E	CH60		No		1

My writing is also mainly online, through my blog and YouTube channel, so both of these saw substantial increases in revenue, too. My YouTube channel is now my main source of income via YouTube advertising, although you didn't mention YouTube or vlogging in one of the categories (where you list the importance of different earning categories), so this may not be fully reflected in your results.	Positive impact	The increase in online activity has opened up new channels, although I may not necessarily take them up - eg paid newsletters through substack or Patreon, brand collaborations etc. It's difficult to measure productivity as I am slowing down as I get older rather than due to the pandemic. I think the pandemic has, however, been very stressful so there is more underlying anxiety. 	1	Yes, sometimes	Friends	Moderately confident	1	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Other	We paid a professional designer £1,400.

I am happy to pay a printer to produce physical books and to upload to Amazon and to create ebooks for KDP. Also I don't mind taking adverts out in literary or niche magazines and doing some marketing myself. Overall, I do not make money out of these enterprises at present - but I enjoy the hobby, (much as someone is happy to spend money on belonging to a swish golf club, but doesn't expect to be come the next Olympic champion!)

Beginning fewer new projects than usual during lock-down resulted in a financial 'hungry gap' that I am just reaching the other side of this month (with payments due mid February).   On the other hand, having so much time at home without so much work gave me more 'dreaming' time than usual, which has resulted in a number of bigger-than-usual visions for new projects, which I hope will go ahead. (So that, overall, perhaps the financial losses caused by covid will be balanced by future gains. I hope so!) 	Positive impact	I write books for children, specialising in books that celebrate nature and encourage green living.   The lockdowns have, in my eyes, given many families a direct experience of the value of nature, which they may not have had time to appreciate in the busyness of normal life. I hope that this will mean that the demand for children's books that celebrate the natural world will continue to grow.	1	Never		Less confident	1	No	0		1		0	0	1	0	0	0	0	0	0				1			0			1	Slightly increased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%				No		0			As in the past I haven't been confident in the jargon of contracts, I've just trusted my agent to deal with the paperwork, and to let me know if there's anything we could negotiate.	I am in the process of negotiating with a publisher about the licensing rights on a book we are planning together. As I said, I would like to be able to re-use my own re-tellings in different (obviously non-competing) markets. In the past I have written traditional tales for educational publishers, and had a clause in my contract allowing me to re-use my re-tellings in the trade market, which I very much valued.

I've lost confidence in the publishing system (very middle class and risk averse). Self-publishing is the way forward, but takes a great deal of work. The way agents / publishers ask for submissions, but don't respond is soul destroying.  Also. Public Lending Right is OK IF your work is in the sample libraries. The libraries that stock my books have been taken off, so income from PLR has dried up.		0

I would have answered 'Not applicable' to some - and did skip some but forgot with others so answered the closest to my situation.   Also I felt the questions didn't always relate to me - for example I haven't self-published within the last year but did several times the year before; I can't remember the royalty rates with my early books although I still regularly receive payments from them.		1

Zoom has substituted fairly adequately for such meetings but it isn't quite as satisfactory.   I haven't PERSONALLY suffered anxiety or stress as a result of the pandemic, but of course I've been concerned about family and friends - and like all of us, I've lost a few.

Negative impact	Since a good proportion of my income was based on working with academics and other authors in Europe and elsewhere, travel constraints were a minor but nonetheless noticeable factor, (and could be alleviated by use of technology such as Zoom for face to face meetings) but the much greater impact came from the disruption of translation and publishing work associated with uncertainties in the world of scientific journals and research monographs. This has meant a substantial decline in income and activity in 2021-2022 which will probably mean a substantial decline in turnover during the tax year 2021-2022. The uncertainty about income levels from this work has created a major strain both at home and in relations with colleagues in the publishing business where many people are losing their jobs or being subjected to great strain in their workplace connected to the unpredictability surrounding their future in publishing. There has however been an upside for those who are self-employed if their income has not been too greatly affected, due to lower expectations in terms of deadlines and less hassle. However the present situation remains one of great uncertainty, and one cannot know what one's income will be in the next couple of years.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	1	1	The contract concerned a translation that I had made. However the publisher (a major US/European-based academic press) had wanted to publish the work with an attribution of translator to two other people who had not in fact contributed in any way to my translation in the work to be published. I thus refused to sign the contract, and to release my copyright until their names were removed as translators of the work. After a brief period of stalemate, the publisher was obliged to concede that the other names would be removed so that publication could take place.	0	0	1	1	1	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	1	1	No change	Other	0-19%	0-19%				No		1	Attribution	I have referred to this earlier in the questionnaire and it concerned the wrongful attribution of others as partial translators in a work that was in fact wholly translated by me. Since the publisher (a major US/European publishing firm) could not publish the book unless I signed the contract to provide a copyright release, I was able to insist on the removal of their names from the published work.

Very negative impact	My mental health has been severely impacted, and though I managed to keep writing throughout much of last year, I subsequently felt that the work I produced was unpublishable.   That and the disappointments of watching my career collapse, along with the severe financial strain the sudden loss of most of my income caused me, have led me to quit writing for the foreseeable future.	0	Never		Very confident	0	No	0	0	1	This is too complicated to cover in detail, but a publisher supplied me with a contract that they subsequently decided was unfit for purpose and then failed to issue a replacement.

There were significant periods of time where I had no work.	Very negative impact	The pandemic brought about a lot of uncertainty for screenwriters - we had no idea when production wold start up again and if we would have a job when it did. This gave most writers, including myself major anxiety which made it difficult to focus or be productive.   When production did start up, due to COVID restrictions writers were asked for more rewrites (which were usually unpaid), had to accept extremely difficult deadlines for last-minute changes and were expected to just get on with it and be grateful for the work.   Face to face meeting with producers and production companies came to a halt and while meetings and story conferences could take place on Zoom, it wasn't the same and left all parties exhausted and with no real sense of connection. These type of meetings are vital to a writer's career as they the prime source of networking and can ensure the next job. Without them or having less of them means less work and also leaves writers, who already work in a very isolated profession, feeling even more alone and on the outside of the film and TV industry.  	1	Yes, sometimes	Agent	Moderately confident		No	0	0	1	The production company refused to adhere to WGGB guidelines for writers.

There have been negative impacts in terms of ability to travel, network, and plan collaborative projects, but in terms of overall earnings I enjoyed a slight upswing in revenue and commissions during the pandemic.

However, the self-employed Covid grant made up for that. The second year I didn't claim the grant. There were still no speaking events or courses. And then my publisher (Lion Hudson) couldn't survive the pandemic and was taken over by SPCK. They are now 'streamlining' the adult fiction line and dropping most of their authors. Result: I don't have a book contract for this year so income down (that is this year, but will only be reflected in tax year 21/22). Income also down on royalties as my publisher struggled to get books into bricks and mortar bookshops due to shops being shut in lockdown. Lion Hudson put publication of all fiction on hold in 2020 and were not offering any new contracts. However, I had the 6th book in a series ready for contract. I felt compelled to waive my advance in order for them to agree to publish it. 	Negative impact	I work from home. In the first year my husband and school age daughter were both working from home too. We have a small house and there was very little room for us all. I felt besieged. I struggled to write as I am so used to silence. I couldn't get away on writing retreats, research trips or even to go write in coffee shops or libraries.  My last book ended up being two months late in delivery to publisher as I couldn't get it finished in the time frame I usually do.   The second year my daughter was back in school (mostly) but husband still working from home. I had a bit more freedom to get out and about but writing at home still a problem.  Unable to do creative writing classes I used to do. No festivals, workshops, readings to meet other writers and speak to readers. I felt very isolated and cut off. Online didn't replace that for me. In fact I felt the online adding to my anxiety as I felt my home was no longer private. I had nowhere to retreat to. And nowhere to escape to. 	1			Very confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1		Stayed the same	1	0		1	Slightly decreased	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0			This last year I felt compelled to agree to waive my advance completely in order to get my book published. The publisher said they would not be able to take the book on unless I waived my advance. I am now moving on from that publisher with a new series that my agent is currently trying to place. I cannot afford to waive an advance again.	Reversion of rights clause is that the book is to be 'made available.' in any form. But that means it can just be made available on Amazon POD and if my sales fall to a trickle I can't get the rights back. I would far prefer a minimum sales threshold.

There was a saving on travel costs.	Negative impact	As libraries and archives were closed, I could not access the much of the published or any of the manuscript materials on which my writing is based. Although many older published work is available online, more recent books (e.g. published within the last 30 years) are not. Some libraries were willing & able to scan limited numbers of pages (within copyright constraints) and send them by email; others were not. Interlibrary loan was only available for items which could be scanned. This had a serious impact on the books which I was contracted to write during the period of Covid-19 restrictions. My anxiety and stress was also severely increased, so that I was less able to write coherently. In addition, as academic conferences did not take place, bookshops were closed, and university courses were not taught or reduced in scope, my usual channels of distribution were closed and my book sales reduced.	0	Never		Very confident	1	Yes	0	1	1	Requirement for the publisher to receive first option on future books.	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	Electronic publication	If you want to sell a self-published book for profit, you will have to spend a lot of time and money promoting it.

Negative impact	COVID-19 meant that during some periods I was not allowed to work in my office (on campus) - I had to work at home. For a couple of months when I had to work at home, my neighbours started to renovate their house - the noise of the renovations significantly increased my anxiety levels (I already experience anxiety exacerbated by noise when working). The experience means that now - even after the situation is no longer an issue - I am more anxious when writing, because I am aware of how sudden writing conditions can be threatened and made nearly impossible. 	0	Never		Less confident	1	Yes	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Other				Other		Don't know		0			I have not noticed any.

One was for overseas markets. Sales of all three were impacted by school closures during CoVid. The lost income is hard to quantify, but am putting it down as 'moderate'. Not sure that the books can ever make up lost ground. 	Negative impact	For one book, the work during CoVid was extremely stressful as the editors / chief graphic designer in the UK were working from home, and the detailed layout was carried out in India, presumably by people also working from home. There were communication problems throughout, and it often felt as if nobody had a handle on the project. The result was some major layout problems which did not show up until the last minute, too late to make text changes to suit. (Think of a format change at third proofs!!!!!!!!)  All very stressful, and deeply painful. As I write this, the experience still hurts!  The two other books went through the writing and production process smoothly. All the layout work was done in the UK by an excellent team that was very familiar with the course, and CoVid did not seem to have any impact. 	0	Never		Moderately confident	1	Yes	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1	10-39%	Increased	1	0	0	1	No change	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	0-19%	Other	They have stayed the same	Yes	0%	0			Have not had a new contract in the past year.

My pension is not payable until I reach retirement age (66) which is in another 6 months, so my only income has really been from some occasional academic work.   royalties etc are nice but certainly are not significant income!  	Positive impact	The stress of remote teaching was becoming too much for me. PTSD that I had recovered from was re-emerging as Stress-related illness so I chose to retire earlier than originally planned.   I am now happy to have the chance to spend my time writing and doing consultancy work but as yet, it's not bringing me any income. 	0	Yes, as a matter of course	Other	Less confident	1	Don't know	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				1		Stayed the same	0			0		Percentage of net receipts		0-19%		Other	They have stayed the same	Yes		0			it's all rather new to me. so I don't really know.   However, one of my co-authors is a very experienced author (50 years+) and is very unhappy with the way things are done these days.  On her advice, I always go to Society of Authors with a contract. 	I have had a bit of dispute with an editor who felt my writing (about signs, symptoms and impact of COVID-19 on ICU patients ) was "too technical" and "too graphic" for a non-specialist audience. This was for a charity, so no contract involved, but it was problematic at the time.

I then went on planned maternity leave in June 2020 and went back to work in January 2021, where again as my employer still mandated remote working, I saved on travel costs. I then changed jobs in May 2021 to work for a fully remote company, so since then the pandemic has not affected my day job earnings.	Negative impact	My productivity has been fine, but having a debut novel come out in the middle of a pandemic has not been ideal - I am aware that many events planned by my publisher (e.g. hand-delivery of advance readers' copies to bookshops, in-person launch event, etc.) had to be cancelled due to Covid, and I can't help wondering how that might have affected sales. Many employees at my publisher were also furloughed, meaning that the rest of the team were overworked and communication with them suffered.	1	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0		1		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts		Yes	10-39%	0			As a relatively new professional writer, it's hard for me to say - I've only signed contracts for two books and haven't noticed much difference between the two contracts.	I thought the 'morality clause' of my first US contract was potentially problematic, as it seemed quite vague in wording: 'if Author’s conduct evidences a lack of due regard for public conventions and morals, or Author commits a crime or any other act that will tend to bring Author into serious contempt, and such behavior would materially damage the Work’s reputation or sales, Publisher may terminate this Agreement and, in addition to Publisher’s other legal remedies, Author will promptly repay the portion of the Advance previously paid to Author, or, if such breach occurred following publication of the Work, Author will promptly repay the portion of the Advance which has not yet been recouped by Publisher.' This clause was deleted in my second US contract - I'm not sure if this was due to pressure from my agent or my publisher's decision!

It also meant that they were more likely to come in incomplete or in need of more administrative checks; the budget for each project is fixed before the job comes in, which meant I would spend more hours on a project but not be paid any extra. 	Negative impact	- Disrupted delivery of mss at the start; later, a run of very urgent mss that were all priority jobs because funding agreements etc. stipulated a certain publication date.  - More admin and emailing with each job (again folded into a fixed budget) to address various Covid-related problems encountered by authors  - General anxiety and stress that affect concentration and productivity. 	0	Never		Less confident	1	Don't know	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0					Weakened	Female	35-44	White	1	PhD		E	YO31				1

In one case, this cost a £2,000 fee as the actual project was cancelled. In another, I had already been paid the fee, but the performance was cancelled - and the performance would have led to publicity and further commissions.   A book was due to launch in April 2020, and this was delayed until 2021, when it launched online only, with no festival appearances and consequently got much less exposure than it would have done otherwise.

A performer claimed to have co-written my original work. I took professional advice and after a lengthy process the claim was formally withdrawn. Though no money was involved, it was extremely distressing.      Something similar happened many years ago when a producer who had written the book for a musical project then sought to claim co-authorship in the lyrics.  In that occasion, the composer resolved it very swiftly in my favour.  It was again, distressing, though quickly resolved.  It has made me wary in future cases. I do a great deal of commissioned work for festivals, special occasions, organisations and individuals, and I am now alert to this danger, though I do not know of a way of preventing it in advance that does not feel brutally legalistic.   It has introduced an anxiety into what would naturally have been positive collaborative relationships.    I looked into legal insurance with a view to taking formal legal action in such cases, but found it prohibitively expensive. The Society of Authors provides advice, and will write on one's behalf (they have never had to do so for me, but offered to do so) but cannot enter into actual legal disputes.  Having twice been stung in this way, I confess to some anxiety over it.   	Lower advances.		Improved	Male	55-64	White	2	PhD	1	W	LD3		Grateful to you for taking an interest		1

Positive impact	2020 was one of my best writing years (in terms of creation!) - particularly during the summer where perhaps I might have previously been distracted by more social activities/holidays (it was as though the pandemic gave you permission to stay at home and not interact - brilliant for us introverts!) - and it gave me the time to self publish paperbacks for the first time (previously I'd only produced ebooks).	0			Moderately confident	0	No			0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	Electronic publication	I used to think getting a traditional publishing deal was my goal, but now I'm quite content with self-publishing. It's great to be in control (of timescales, cover designs, etc.) and there are no gatekeepers, only direct feedback from readers. I have created a small team to assist me (cover designer, photographer for cover images, proofreader, etc.) and am now reasonably confident with the processes involved. Yes, there is lots of work involved in typesetting, and so forth, but it gets easier the more often you do it. Yes, there is lots of marketing involved, and that's always difficult, but I understand from fellow authors who are traditionally published that there is still marketing involvement expected of them anyway, so I don't think it makes much difference.	1	0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		20-39%	60-79%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0			N/A		Not changed	Female	45-54	White	2	Masters	1	E	TF6				1

I had more online creative writing teaching work, though less opportunities to promote book sales and attend in-person events. And less opportunity to make progress with a new book. 	Negative impact	Certainly increased anxiety, reduced creativity, and a general feeling of treading water and taking comfort in the certainty of paid creative writing teaching work, rather than actively pursuing new writing projects. A lack of ability to travel also hindered a new book project. 	1	Never		Less confident	0	Don't know	1	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	1

However, I also had planned a gap in writing - and the two books which came in afterwards were low advances and paid slightly weirdly so they fell outside the tax year so it isn't quite as bad as it looked. 	Positive impact	BAD: no library or archive access, massive meltdown in lockdown 1 as all my work disappeared.  GOOD: pivoted to write terrible corporate book which made me realise I could churn them out if necessary.   OVERALL: now appear to be virtually full-time writer with an excellent track record in producing high quality work on time (but also bored witless and missing audiences and real research).	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Other	Moderately confident	1	No	0	1	1	Mainly on fee structures.

Lewis’s house on the outskirts Oxford, based on my knowledge and writings on him and his friends. The touring was becoming more and more popular, mainly from overseas groups. A number of US visitors had read or knew about my books. The tours had to stop because of the covid dangers. It only recently that the house was able to open again for visitors. We impose safety restrictions carefully thought put. The tours are just slowly increasing. As I live fairly near to Oxford it is viable for me to continue tours.  As I travel to my small office, where most of my books are, the rise in fuel costs is a pain. This will also lessen my takings too from my tour guiding. However it is always a refreshing break from the writing. Healthy.	No impact	The stress of covid is mainly the impact that most feel. My work actually gives a continuing structure that helps health. I do however need to plan my work more, which is a good thing, as I’m getting older now in my seventies. Zoom has opened up possibilities, as I less frequently get invited to speak on the US. Oxford is a good place to be near, for me, as a writer. I’ve had to avoid The Bodleian for over two years, but things are changing.	0			Moderately confident	1	Yes			0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	1	1

They won't budge on this. And it seems unreasonable when copyright for articles used to be 'first printing rights', sometimes with a limit on how soon the work could be resold.  It seems unfair that there is no payment for articles kept online. You used to write an article, it would be printed , the publication printed it once and you were paid once. Now articles are kept online indefinitely and although you the author are only paid once the publication continues to earn income from your work via subscription fees or advertising payments. This seems really unfair. 		1

Less willing to agree reversion rights, which I have exercised under some 1970s and 1980s contracts. In some cases, their records are so poor that they don't seem to realise that rights have been reverted. 	Publishers seem to be pushing more legal liabilities onto authors in case of litigation but it is hard to pin this down and separate it from wider legal changes.	Weakened	Male	65-74	White	3	PhD	1	E	NG8		Increasingly considering self-publication - with Print On Demand services, the main reason to go with a traditional publisher for academic writing is marketing and distribution - but they no longer do much of this. If I have to do all the promotion via Twitter, etc, I might as well cut them out, apart from UKRI requirements - but I plan to retire to avoid these. Also looking at this as a way to reach the borderline trade/academic market without having to struggle to find an agent, although I would like to use them if the initial works succeed. 		1

Facebook, collapsed in the early stages of the pandemic. This significantly raised the ROI on ads and this led to a significant increase on profits for my backlist.

Another 2 days on launch prep and launch activity. 1 day formatting and publishing eBooks and paperbacks and reviewing test prints. 2 days working with beta team. (although this can be much higher, depending on what they find) 3 days and about £3,000 - £5,000 on running adverts. £300 on cover art. £250 on line editing.  That's the initial launch. If a backlist title looks promising, I may put more time and money into it. For my most successful self-published title to date (about 58,000 sales) I've spent several weeks of effort in the years since its launch to promote it, rework the advertising copy, and change cover art.	1	1		Decreased	1	0		0		Percentage of net receipts	60-79%	60-79%	60-79%	Percentage of net receipts	They have gone up	No		0			None.

Frankly, I found this insulting and ludicrous.  Also, I was unclear where I was to respond about audiobooks, which represents a far greater part of my writing income than printed books.	3	1

Sadly, another publisher of three popular magazines switched in the other direction and now demand all rights for fiction content.	I have signed away all rights to short fiction content for certain publishers who demand it. I am really torn on this: the income from these magazines makes it much easier to scrape a living as a writer, but there could be a principle at stake here, too.	Weakened	Female	45-54	White	3	Masters	1		BT63		You do not seem to allow me to enter the region where I live as Northern Ireland. I am (not just as a result of this survey) really thinking hard about selling all rights to certain of my short stories. I had reconciled myself to a position that I was, at least some of the time, writing as an artisan, akin to a potter, and was happy to craft my work and send it out into the world  in exchange for payment, not necessarily expecting anyone to remember that I made it. But I'm really not sure if this position is OK.		1

Both my wife and I are retired and writing is my saviour when diagnosed with MS when I was 26 years old.  A numbness from the knees down to the feet and from the elbows to fingers and round the middle - lower stomach - this has been termed as a mild strain.  My first book was a  "A Touch of Heaven" followed by "Christmas is Coming" and "I Remember it Well"  all the books were short stories.  I started to write thrillers and that genre were "Mistaken Identity" followed by "A Joyride to Murder" and "The Steal" until I discovered Bertram Bear.  My first Children's book and I won an accolade presented the Sussex Newspaper - "The Adventures of Bertram Bear" voted book of the year 2019 Editor's choice.   "Bertram Bear and the  Rivals" also published and there will be 16 more books.  Also published "The Christmas Tree Story" The Children's books are illustrated - first book Amanda Breach B.A. and the second book by Mira Homer B.A. and M.A.  Not knowing if I have received any earnings for my books - because at first before joining ALCS - I just wrote for fun and also lose myself from the pain!	Positive impact	I suppose stress has a lot to answer for in my life - whether I was going to be unlucky to catch Covid-19 or Omicron or any other variant on the market and of course I try to look at it with a comical outlook as having MS can have its funny side!  We test at home if we are going out and I still wear a mask and so does my wife who has multi medical problems as well.  We don't feel the government is going the right way and I can't say I have any confidence in their ability to protect the people of this country.  Just my own opinion being a Columnist for two online Newspapers, I am also an Editor for a National News Magazine South East - National Operatic and Dramatic Association.	1	Never		Very confident	0	No		0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0								Don't know		0					Not changed	Male	85 and over	White	2	Secondary school	1	E	BN20				1

Negative impact	Tp being with I was fine, but the stress of having to supply books that I know would not sell as well in the coming years eventually impacted on my mental health. I let my publisher was not working as hard as it could have done and my genre (saga) was left to flounder. Bigger names had their publication dates put on hold whereas saga authors went out onetime without the promotion etc. I paid for my own PR though a public relations company in order to help readers see I had new books out.

Savings on travel offset by the need to increase investment in technology and some training for that.	No impact	Again it's evened out. I work from home most of the time but there was some pressure as a result of family members also having to work from home. One positive was that some competitors seemed to stop working. There's no evidence that pushed more work my way but with fewer people sending to the media It was easier to get my work published. Another positive was that one or two difficult clients stopped using me so I was able to drop them and concentrate on those who value my work.	0	Never		Moderately confident	0	No	0	0	0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			0		Other				Other	They have stayed the same	Yes	90-100%	0			None.

In 2020 when everyone was in lockdown there was more remote work. Now, it's increasingly rare. On the other hand, my expenses in 2020-21 were far fewer than normal, as I was not travelling all round the country regularly to do workshops and reading. Obviously the cost of living crisis is going to impact on this massively, as expenses of working at home go up too. 		There have been some negative elements and some positives. Being able to work remotely more have actually been amazing for me, as for many disabled writers - it made me realised how much I was draining myself by dashing around to do in-person events. I managed to write a whole book between July 2020 and May 2021, which I never would have been able to do if I were travelling for work too. On the other hand, it's been isolating and deeply frustrating and depressing as the literary world has celebrated being back in-person and largely forgotten about those of us who can't be yet, for whom there is no covid-safe environment still now. Disabled writers are being let down and shut out. 	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Professional body/union	Moderately confident	0	No	1	1	1	advice from society of authors to amend some tiny parts of contract	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	0				0			0			1	Slightly increased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price					They have stayed the same	No		0			n/a	n/a	Not changed	Female	35-44	White	2	PhD	1	E	LA22				1

Employed work (also not writing-related) has stayed largely the same. Plus, since 2020, I've been able to query and sell my first novel - the injection of time really helped.	Positive impact	Harder and more stressful to work, access to research much reduced, access to networking opportunities much reduced - but while my productivity got worse, the time available during lockdown was much more, and a few solid months of furlough income were really good for editing creative work. I enjoyed it much less - very hard to concentrate or be creative during lockdown/the pandemic in general - but I did manage to use the time to finish a big project, which I then sold, so since the pandemic things have definitely taken an upturn for me professionally.	1	Yes, sometimes	Agent	Moderately confident	0	No	0	1	1	Royalties, extent of rights	0	1	1	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			1	0	0	1		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts		No		0			I have only signed one contract (and one agent's agreement) to date.

As a freelancer, a small business owner, and a writer, COVID has been a nightmare to deal with. I wasn't eligible for furlough for my company, but I could access the SEISS grant however I have now found out that taking that grant has impacted my ability to get a mortgage as it's seen as a negative thing. This is another blow that I didn't need - I would rather have gone hungry than take the grants had I realised it would impact my future affordability on my home. Things went quiet in 2021 freelance wise, and whilst things are now beginning to pick up, the increase in household costs is making things very difficult again. I left full time work to write part time and do marketing consultancy part time, and at this stage, I'm considering going back into full time work as this just doesn't feel sustainable anymore. It's very upsetting though because writing is my passion. 	Very negative impact	I am the most stressed I've ever been - I am hardly writing at all as I am having to spend almost all my time looking for paid work. The cost of living is going up in an alarming way compared to the money on offer for freelance work in my sector. All of this has a huge impact on my writing as it feels now more than ever a luxury that I can't afford. Writing itself (my books) earns a pitifully small amount of annual revenue for me and so whilst it's my passion, I'm having to think of putting it aside for the moment so I can afford my home. 	0	Never		Less confident	0	Yes	1		0		0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	0				0			0			1	No change	Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%	0-19%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	Don't know		0					Improved	Female	35-34	White	2	Masters	1	E	HD7				1

I'd been working on a novel for four years, so really feel like I missed a lot... now, there are editors tweeting opps, and honestly, I spend hours sending work, pitching, and pushing or repurposing work to the point there are 2 or 3 writers here... it doesn't necessarily pay, but I'm continuing to grow and meet new editors, or opps, and you just keep at it... always harder to do the long novel work, but you just rise up and do it. Finding ACLS was amazing and I was surprised to see with just a few things how much was earned. I took the time to add more for next time. 	Very positive impact	Stress is just a busy mind, a person who can't allocate peace/stillness, so I don't believe in it or subscribe to any language of 'it's too much.' What's too much is a person's attention to it. I don't, so I honestly did not really notice there was a pandemic, nor war... I honor my time and space and get the work done. I'm thriving, but then I was even before, and I will never find accomplishment in the success of money but in doing honest work with love and enthusiasm. 	0	Never		Very confident	0	No	1	1	1	Not sure...

So I've declined to work with them. I decline more contracts than I accept.	There are an amazing amount of new people agenting with little to no experience; they are branching off to their own companies, but do not have legal in place, or a legit contract. As a business writer, I can tell if they've had a legal rep craft it... more often, I find that they contain very old/antiquated language--even easy things like, 'he or she' will... and I ask for it to be corrected. I still find hidden fees. I find contracts that are taking percentages of rights that don't exist... for instance, I anticipate that with Brandon Sanderson's 15.5 million dollar GoFundMe, agents, publishers, will contract for a share of this... or they contract for tech that hasn't been created... I find in some cases that in film, there is a non-union agenda of paying less than even .5 or 1% of budget and as low as $5K for a script, where it used to be 20-25K. I find most places, in short fiction, etc., will ask to keep the piece stored when we are colonizing Mars... and I won't do this. But that said, most of these places are junk and disappear in a year. 	Perpetual clause; keeping the work online archived forever; not being able to see accounting records. I have an agent contract to review and they are passing fees on, legit ones, like money transfer rate fees, but can't abide. I find there is a lot of unclear language in the way you are able to change the work and the publisher is... there is this fine line that they can alter the work or if you don't agree, you are unable to do anything... covers remain an issue... a publisher will market your book as (say) a gift book and it's scholarly, or you end up with a naked woman when you would be appauled to have such a cover assoc with your work. The point of no return clause, basically, when you can't change the work, but they can, or they can publish without your say-so.

Negative impact	COVID-19 has totally reduced my social life so my energies went into my work. I spent a lot of my time 'at work'. At the start of 2020 I was incredibly concerned about getting COVID and stopped seeing ANY clients face-to-face and in person. I doubt that will ever be resolved and I will continue to work 100% online. My publisher, even though they are truly lovely, also probs reduced their input/output as production and distribution were affected considerably by the pandemic. COVID-19 did/does increase my stress levels as there is a constant worry I could get COVID-19 and die. Also my husband is vulnerable with a heart issue and I have 2 long-term chronic conditions. The pandemic did produce a need to think of other ways of doing things and that 'challenge' gave me something else to focus on, rather than continually worrying I could catch a fatal virus.

Self-publishing an audio-book was equally bonkers-driving but was also a wonderfully creative experience. I host a weekly podcast and it seemed a natural extension of that. I'm planning on my next book also being an audio-book. I wouldn't use Amazon again. I've used them in the past and it's like using a robot. The platforms I use now have real people in charge that reply to queries and are helpful. Amazon almost put me off self-publishing, but my replacement rekindled the fire. Fab. I've self-published enough times now to not be flummoxed and I enjoy it. It's the creative part I love the most:) xx	1	0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%	40-59%	Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have stayed the same	No		0					Not changed	Female	55-64	White	2	Secondary school	1	E	BA2				1

One I self-published and have earned almost nothing from; the other I 'sold' to a digital-first publisher with no advance (I have yet to see any royalties from its recent publication). Thankfully, I also changed genres and that saved me financially as the new genre has been more successful and I've sold 4 books in that genre since late 2019, with small advances. I used to write on retreats several times a year and put all those expenses down against income; having to write at home constantly has lowered my allowable expenses, so I've paid more tax! In general, publisher unwillingness to acquire or pay for acquisition has hugely impacted my earnings. During the pandemic my income more than halved. This current tax year my income has almost halved again, so I now earn a quarter of what I did pre-pandemic. I have not seen a big uptick in ebook sales as others did, unfortunately, but that may be down to genre/author name. 	Negative impact	Mainly stress from money issues.	1	Yes, as a matter of course	Agent	Moderately confident	0	No	1	1	1	Mainly clauses to do with being forced to offer my next book to that publisher. They tend to want all books to be offered to them, regardless, and I always insist on it being specific to one genre or author name. Other clause issues - royalties/rights - tend to be dealt with by my agent and I leave that to them. 	0	0	0	0	0	0	0	1	1	Electronic publication	I find digital books relatively easy and simple to produce via Amazon and have about 150 digital titles on Amazon. I do not use other platforms as they seem to be a waste of time. Paperback self-pub is rather harder, due to formatting issues that can be time-consuming and frustrating, and they are always more expensive to sell and earn lower royalties, so I don't sell many.   There are no particular costs incurred by self-pub on Amazon, apart from one's own time spent on getting it right/promoting it. (I have never been PAID to promote by a publisher, so not being paid to promote my own books is hardly a point of contention. I have also never really had a lot of marketing input from publishers in general and I've been doing this over two decades with many different (mainly big) publishers, so again, new writers who expect publishers to promote their books for them beyond a few tweets and maybe a blog tour at publication are living in a fantasy. I'd be ecstatic if they did, but I have never seen it happen to me. They save their big money campaigns for Big New Things and already bestselling authors.) 	0	0			1	0		1	Substantially decreased	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%	20-39%	Percentage of net receipts	They have stayed the same	No		0					Improved	Female	55-64	White	3	Diploma	1	E			We need to force publishers to stop offering no-advance contracts which is killing the ability of writers to be professional, i.e. to earn a living from their work, and also encourage them to promote books and support authors in general more than they do. 		0

This dramatically and negatively affects cash flow for an author (who uses an advance to survive while writing) while this change of policy solely benefits the publisher by reducing their risk and keeping their money. This also changes the whole principle of an advance which is to allow a 'liveable' (!) wage while writing into a fee at the end. A very unfair practice for authors.

In my blog I talk about all of my activities including: the festival I organise the teaching I do and the events I've appeared at. It was very valuable when I started out but it does take up a lot of time. Writing a good blog post can take a few hours and that's not work I get "paid" for as such. I do like doing it because I like being open about what an author's life is like. That said its primary purpose is to market myself & my activities. If I had a publicist or agent to "market" me and publicise my books I'm not sure that I would continue doing it.   	0	0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price						Yes		0					Not changed	Female	35-44	White	2	Masters	1	E		0				56000	24000	6100

I was also the author at an open day and did two festivals but I wasn't paid or paid expences for any of them.  A festival and open day were both very expensive because of the distance to travel and over night accommodation. I know I have to pay my dues and earn a reputation (if I am lucky) so I have done as many events as would have me whilst trying to build my name.  It has cost me far more than I have earned and if my husband wasn't able to support me I would certainly not have been able to do the majority them.	1	0				1		0		Other		0-19%												Female	45-54	White	2	Other	1	S		0				66000		1000

We changed this to for 3 years and thereafter non-exclusive. The time for settling payments was reduced from 6 months to 3 months. The definition of competing work which my co-editor and I agreed not to take on was tightened making it less vague.	1	1	1	0	0	0	1	1				0	0			0	0		1		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	0-19%	0-19%		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		Yes		1	Attribution	You might not call this a dispute but on a book I was editing the publishers failed to attribute properly the work of contributors and artists. I had to insist on it being done properly even though the contributors and artists had contracts in which publishers had agreed to do it.		The time given for proofreading was too short (10 days).  I feel concerned about the clause to do with inspecting the publishers' accounts at the cost of Â£30 per hour. I am not sure how this would play out in reality if I ever needed to do it.

Seem to want non-involvement other than one-off payment for production only and to take all credit once produced despite their being the primary pre-agreed 'agent' in terms of advertising and making the work known.	0	1	90-100%	Increased	0	0	0	1	Substantially increased	Percentage of retail/publisher's price						Yes	0%	1	Attribution	Produced the idea for an edited collaborative volume and the organisation put in their own named editor from a different organisation reducing my right to that of producing just a single chapter under my own name. The named editor status is a requirement for next grade promotion in the area of work I was in therefore the named editor benefits instead. Since that person had formally attracted me into the organisation there was little I could do to rectify apart from creating a further volume with someone else under my own control by then an edited volume in my own name was no longer useful to the alternative career pathway I had ended up on.	Downloading has replaced any income received from photocopying payment and is part of the purchase contract for journals. So essentially I have lost any publishing income that is not part of the initial production contract for a work. All writing is now for status or to help me complete an existing job more effectively.	Having to pass on work at cost only after production and not being allowed to make an income beyond the initial production payment on the basis that the 'audience' for the work is already paying subscriptions to the funding organisation and thus work is considered part of the funders output to their contributors.

I paid an editor to check my work and only later realised she was rubbish and had missed a lot of errors. I paid regularly on social media to promote my book but with few results.

Iâ€™m now trapped in a situation where my publisher has effectively â€˜sunkâ€™ my book and I canâ€™t get the rights back or make them try harder. One example is that recently I realised my book is not available to buy on kindle (only the biggest digital platform...) due to technical issues. They have not even tried to correct it stating simply that it is an issue they have with kindle orders and thatâ€™s that. Not good enough but what can I do?	No advance in last book.

Huge amounts of unpaid time spent marketing of course (tho conventionally-published writers do that too and many complain their publishers don't market enough/at all). No actual costs to do it except my illustrator (I edited/proofed myself; again time-consuming but again I hear from some writers who have editors of mistakes and oversights). I have invested in things like Giveaways (Amazon is reasonable - just the cost of the books; Goodreads is expensive). A downside is that many libraries are sniffy about taking self-pub books even as a donation - and it's hard logistically for bookshops to stock Print On Demand even if they want to.	0	0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price						Don't know	0%	0					Not changed	Female	55-64	White	1	Masters	1	E		0				22000	22000	5065

The linking of books on a contract. You won't get money on one book unless another has earned out. I will check this next time. Also the option clause giving the publisher first refusal on the next book once a contract is complete.l I have to check this one every time as it keeps slipping in..

Three years ago on changing from one literary house to another I had to waive previously ring-fenced rights to an independent publishing deal in Canada - in order to obtain an advance for global rights.  This time I needed to sell global rights simply in order to approximate the advance of my last contract for non-global rights.	I'm never sure how e-rights or digital rights will really affect me in the future and sometimes feel I have to trust quite blindly to what my agent understands to be 'industry standards'.

Indemnity is the biggest problem - why should I indemnify a multi-million pound business when they have the ultimate editorial control?

I'm commissioned by email. The publisher I mainly work for tried to introduce a contract but I (and colleagues) refused to sign it as it stood and the publisher has yet to redraft it. My main reasons for not signing were that the publisher wanted me to accept legal liabity for my copy.		Weakened	Female	45-54	White	4	Other	1	E		0				90000	45000	45000

Some of these professional skills I swap with friends; some such a developmental editing I pay for. There is a thriving and relatively cheap cover market so my covers have costs between $30 for cheap giveaway ebooks and Â£200. Marketing can suck up enormous time. Some things like Instafreebie and mailchimp lists are relatively cheap and effective. Paid promotion sites are of limited value particularly for YA and children's work - often writers see no return on paid promotions except for perhaps Bookbub which is very expensive and hard to secure.	1	0			0	0		0	Substantially increased	Other				Other		Yes		0			I can only compare to the agented deals friends had been offered shortly before my offer and my agent's comments on the market. That said the advance I was offered by an independent print publisher was dismal - Â£1000 for three books with a 7.5% cut of net receipts. I said no and instead sold the digital and audio rights to an Amazon imprint which paid $1500 and a 50% royalty rate on actual price and self published the paperback. This kind of hybrid contract is not without difficulties - for most competitions libraries and magazine sites you are neither self published nor traditionally published and so your book usually is eligible.   The other difference my agent and I saw was a rights grab in trad publishers' offers - they typically wanted global rights in perpetuity. Amazon has also bought global rights for ebook and audio including translation rights but it is pretty good at reverting them if they decide not to use them. Audio rights can be reverted within 90 days of contract for example if Kindle Press decides not to exercise them.		Improved	Female	45-54	White	1	Degree	1	E		0				40000	40000	10000

I was offered a risible percentage by an established publisher by a junior unable to conceive of the inadequate business proposition. The viable book did not happen as a result.

Outlay in the last 12 months has been for cover art usage only. Most independent publishing platforms provide their services for free and only take a very small portion of earnings from a work that is sold. My average work week is between 47 and 60 hours including all publishing tasks which at the beginning of your publishing path are hours not remunerated. This is why most authors even independent ones have a day job.	1	0			1	0	1	0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		0-19%		Percentage of retail/publisher's price	They have gone up	Yes		0					Not changed	Female	45-54	White	4	Masters	1	Other		1					0	350

As standard. After consulting with a friend and someone from my former agency I successfully negotiated for a contract where I retained copyright. But I was shocked this was necessary. Apparently the Hearst organization is famous for its punitive contracts with writers.		Improved	Male	65-74	Mixed	2	Degree	1	E		0				20000	5200	9000

Increasingly offered less money than I was 10-20 years ago from the same publishers.	I don't like the clauses where I have to indemnify the publisher in case I write anything that will cause offence. Some readers in the US (Creationists) find it offensive if you write that the Universe started with a Big Bang although that is the generally accepted view. Should I worry about this?

Publishers never tell me about reprints either.	I don't like signing over film rights or any other versions of the story. I usually ask for film rights to be removed from print contracts with a view to separate negotiations if the matter arises. I can explain that in more detail on request.

I have also published 2 books with a traditional publisher and the experience was very positive. However self-publishing has much bigger rewards per copy. About Â£1.30 a copy to me as opposed to about 20p (this is the figure to me; the profits were split with my co-writer).    Once unpaid time is factored in I think the rewards might be similar for same level of sales.	1	0		Increased	0			1	No change	Percentage of net receipts		0-19%		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		No		0			Signed a buy-out contract for audiobook sitcom. All rights ceded to further exploitation. It was the last-chance saloon for the script but it still felt wrong having to cede these rights.	See above.

Have not really acquired readership locally. My novels are mystery adventure romantic thriller science fiction and a poetry anthology. I post on social media but again I don't believe I target my readership. Social media occupants do not necessarily read novels and poetry. I receive positive responses on American e-book sites but this does not translate to sales. Bit suspicious about how much is known about my works without anyone making a purchase overseas? I have not "launched" any of my four novels. My wife does not want the celebrity tag.  However interest has been shown recently because a sequel to my first novel a mystery sea adventure is with. Organizations that received copes three year previously are now getting back to ask for another copy. It is factual that I've given away more copies  than I've sold.  With the sequel I hope to sell more than I give away. My novels have been loaned from the local library.  On each publication I contact a range of appropriate bookshops but have never received a reply. The local bookshop reluctantly accepted two copies of Dancing on the Beach by Sam Grant and of my Poems with themed notes respectively. These include my give away copies listing. It was said that self-published authors are not liked  by bookshops.  I've appeared three times on local radio and each time was asked for free copies. I have kept positive and realize that I lack any meaningful  publicity medium  to promote my works.  My publisher is keen on my latest novel and there is interest for a sequel. I enjoy writing novels short stories and poetry. My poems have been regularly published in anthologies for seven years.

I choose to now buy bulk books and sell them myself to getter better payout.	1	0			0			0		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		60-79%		Percentage of retail/publisher's price		No		0			only just started as professional write so not sure.	not applicable to me		Female	35-44	White	1	Masters	1	E		0				12000	1200000	200

The liability should be joint.	Improved	Male	55-64	White	2	Degree	1	E		0				74000	24000	14000

I refuse to do it now so they go to more naÃ¯ve younger people who know less and I know other professionals do the same resulting in a lack of quality in production in historical documentaries. The BBC do not seem to care though and are constantly ripping off authors ideas instead of working with them and paying them for their years of knowledge.	I get paid less.

My second publisher had me down as earning nothing from foreign rights sales but renegotiated after the book went to eleven foreign editions and I threatened to throw my teddies out of the pram.

The longer titles (40-100K words) are often also available in Amazon-created ppb. I incur no particular costs except cover copyright which is usually about Â£10 each. As someone with previous editorial/publishing experience myself I do all my own formatting editing and design work for both e-books and ppbs. I never use paid advertising for self-published books just publicise on my own Twitter account(s) a few hours weekly.	0	0			0	1	1	1	Substantially increased	Percentage of net receipts	0-19%	0-19%		Percentage of net receipts	They have gone up	Yes		0			The only obvious thing I can think of is the advent of emailed contracts where no PHYSICAL copy exists and you electronically sign a contract via Docusign or whatever it's called. I find that tricky as I like to see things on paper.	Competition clauses as always: restricting me from publishing other works in the same genre within 12 months of a title's publication date. Not very helpful when you are prolific and want to move on to a different publisher but have to wait a year or publish under a different (i.e. new) name. There was also an audio contract I negotiated separately from my agent which kept rights for 8 years which I felt was an excessively long time. But it was for a self-published novella so I shrugged it off as insignificant.	Weakened	Female	45-54	White	5 or more	Secondary school	1	E		0				111000	81000	81000

Magazines in particular want 'all rights'. Some are open to negotiation but many aren't. It's getting harder to make money from exploiting different rights in your won work because more publishers are taking a greater realm of rights from us. Gone are the days when you could sell the same short story to magazines in the UK Australia Ireland South Africa. They all want World rights or to be the first in the world to publish it in the English language.		Improved	Male	45-54	White	1	University entry	1	E		0		2		14000	14000	8000
